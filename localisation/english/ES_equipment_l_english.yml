The 'Fagot' became one of the most widely produced ATGMs of its generation, seeing extensive export and use in various armed conflicts."
aa_9k32_strela_2_equipment_desc: "The 9K32 'Strela-2' MANPADS was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and became the first widely deployed system for countering low-altitude aerial threats. It is designed to protect against air attacks, especially from helicopters and low-flying aircraft. The system is simple to use, highly mobile, and became a standard weapon for many nations' armed forces over several decades. Despite its effectiveness, it has some limitations, such as susceptibility to jamming and a restricted range."
aa_9k34_strela_3_equipment_desc: "The 'Strela-3' is an upgraded version of the 'Strela-2' MANPADS developed in the 1980s. This model offers significantly improved performance, including more accurate targeting and enhanced resistance to countermeasures, making it effective in challenging combat conditions. The system is better suited for engaging fast-moving and maneuverable targets, thanks to its advanced guidance system. Additionally, the 'Strela-3' is designed for rapid deployment, greatly enhancing troop mobility."
aa_9k38_igla_equipment_desc: "The 'Igla' MANPADS represents a major advancement in portable air-defense systems. Developed in the 1980s, it gained popularity for its high accuracy and ability to operate effectively in heavily jammed environments, including against flares and electronic countermeasures. The 'Igla' is simple to use, highly reliable, and versatile across various scenarios. It has proven effective against helicopters, aircraft, and even drones, establishing itself as a key weapon for protecting troops and assets on the battlefield."

In July 2017, a contract was signed for the delivery of the first Mi-38 helicopters to the Russian Ministry of Defense, and by 2019, the first units were delivered. The helicopter can be used for cargo and passenger transport, search and rescue missions, and flights over land and water bodies. The Mi-38 can operate in a wide range of climatic conditions, including maritime, tropical, and cold climates."

RUS_hel_strike_equipment_mi28n_desc: "The Mi-28N "Night Hunter" is a Soviet and Russian attack helicopter produced by JSC "Rosvertol," part of the "Russian Helicopters" holding company. It is designed for searching and destroying tanks and other armored vehicles, as well as low-speed aerial targets and enemy personnel, under conditions of active fire resistance. The Mi-28 is capable of performing aerobatic maneuvers, such as the Nesterov loop, Immelmann turn, barrel roll, side flight, backward flight, and sideways flight at speeds of up to 100 km/h. The helicopter is capable of operating day and night in both simple and complex weather conditions."
hel_strike_equipment_2_desc: "This is a modification of the Mi-24, developed to enhance its firepower and combat effectiveness. It was created based on the Mi-24D and received a number of significant improvements."
RUS_hel_strike_equipment_mi28nm_desc: "The modernized version of the Mi-28N "Night Hunter" attack helicopter. Development of the modification began in 2009. The modification features an over-rotor radar system, the N025. The ball above the main rotor helps the crew detect targets even outside the line of sight. Additionally, the Mi-28NM’s main rotor blades are made from composite materials, allowing the helicopter to complete its flight even if the rotor is hit by 20–30 mm caliber projectiles. The navigator's cockpit has a fully integrated control system, meaning that even in the event of a direct hit to the pilot’s cockpit, the navigator will be able to continue the flight."
UKR_hel_transport_equipment_mi8_desc: "The Mi-8, created in the same years, is one of the most mass-produced twin-engine helicopters in the world. Its first flight took place on June 24, 1961, and serial production started in 1965. This helicopter is used for transport, air assault, medical, search-and-rescue, and combat missions. It has a crew of 3 people, can carry up to 24 passengers, reaches a speed of up to 250 km/h, and its service ceiling is 4,500 meters."
