 re_event_r.1.a: "Inhuman!"
 re_event_r.1.desc: "This morning, two video recordings were posted on Reddit and Twitter showing a bunch of Ukrainian Banderites torturing and abusing our captured soldiers in the village of Mala Rohan in Kharkiv region. According to Checknews, the video was posted by soldiers of the special forces unit 'Kraken' associated with the 'Azov' regiment, which was allegedly fighting nearby. This crime once again shows the cruelty and inhumanity of the AFU and its neo-Nazi government. We will not leave this crime without punishment and will severely punish all those involved."

 re_event_r.10.desc: "On March 16, 2022, by the hands of Nazis from the 'Azov' regiment, the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater was blown up. The purpose of the provocation was to blame our air forces for bombing the theater and killing civilians who were allegedly hiding from shelling there. The building could not in any way be considered a military target by our armed forces, as it is a civilian facility. Moreover, on March 16, we did not conduct air strikes against ground targets in Mariupol."

 re_event_r.3.a: "Lies, deception and provocation"
 re_event_r.3.desc: "Recently, Ukrainian media reported that a kindergarten and nursery in Akhtyrka, a small town in Sumy region, were hit during another shelling. Our Ministry of Defense refused to comment on the situation, while media sympathetic to us claim that Ukrainian military combatants were in those buildings. This is obviously another deliberate provocation to discredit us. Comments are unnecessary."

 re_event_r.4.desc: "For 8 years, terrible things have been happening on Donbass territory caused by the armed forces of Ukraine - so, a few days ago, during the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from a major city that, despite temporary occupation by the AFU, belongs to the DPR - Kramatorsk, a missile strike with 'Tochka-U' was made on the local train station. As a result of the terrorist attack, 61 people were killed, about 110 received injuries. Despite the obvious involvement of the AFU in this tragedy, the international community blamed us and qualified it as 'another Russian war crime in Ukraine'."

 re_event_r.5.a: "Those guilty of killing unarmed soldiers will be punished!"
 re_event_r.5.desc: "Today, information about the execution of Russian servicemen near Makeyevka village surfaced on the Internet. The published video shows at least ten Russian soldiers surrendering to four Ukrainian soldiers. One by one, Russian soldiers exit the shed and lie face down on the ground when suddenly an eleventh Russian soldier appears and opens fire on the Ukrainians, catching them by surprise, after which the video ends. In another video, about 12 dead Russian soldiers are seen lying in the same area as in the first video. It is unknown when and who filmed these videos, but this is clearly a war crime and violation of international humanitarian law. Our soldiers at the moment of killing were lying unarmed with their hands outstretched or behind their heads, making them prisoners of war or non-combatants, which means there was no need for their execution."

 re_event_r.8.desc: "Today, a video was distributed on popular resources showing a scene of mass voluntary surrender of Ukrainian military personnel, including from the 'Azov' regiment.

 re_event_r.9.desc: "The Ministry of Defense quickly learned that contract servicemen were in the zone of the special military operation. But despite our complaints against Shoigu, no measures were taken to return them from the front line. During this time, as it turned out, some conscript soldiers were captured while others were killed. It will not be possible to hide this information from parent committees and the media, including thanks to the SBU, which is already distributing many videos with our prisoners. This lawlessness must end before more die."

 re_event_u.1.desc: "Today another Russian missile hit a residential building in Kyiv. Fortunately, no one died or was injured. Russia denies the strike and claims that the building was hit by a Ukrainian air defense missile from the S-300 system, but this is undoubtedly just a lie and an attempt to hide its barbaric actions. Right?"

 re_event_u.10.desc: "Abundant amounts of videos, photographs and audio materials proving the involvement of Russian military in atrocities against civilians are now actively spreading throughout the international community, shocking ordinary people with the cruelty of the Russian army. Russia is violating huge amounts of international conventions and treaties. Russia is waging war not just against us, it is waging war against our people. Evidence is being recorded, necessary evidence will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council, to a special commission. We will do everything to prove that Russia is not a 'civilized country' at all, but just a collection of savages, orcs."

Our servicemen, despite all the atrocities of the Russians on our land, calmly capture them, holding weapons at low ready. Then suddenly an eleventh Russian soldier appears and opens fire on the Ukrainians. In the second video all eleven soldiers of the RF Armed Forces are dead. When the fact of the incident was revealed, the Russians immediately accused us of a war crime against prisoners of war. Our soldiers bear no guilt in this situation, as the killed soldiers resisted and falsely surrendered. Since false surrender is not covered by Geneva Convention rules, the execution of Russian military personnel was fully justified."

At that moment, hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the basement of the theater from shelling, which the occupiers well knew, as a large white inscription 'CHILDREN' was painted on both sides of the theater. The bomb shelter under the building was largely preserved and about 130 people were rescued from it. The exact death toll is not established, but estimates range from 200 to 600 dead under the rubble. Full debris clearance and investigation is hindered by continued shelling by Russian forces, who deny their guilt."
