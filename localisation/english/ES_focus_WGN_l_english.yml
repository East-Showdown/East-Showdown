WGN_utkin_orchestra: "Utkin Orchestra"
WGN_utkin_orchestra_desc: "Dmitry "Wagner" Utkin is a Russian GRU special forces officer, reserve lieutenant colonel, holder of four Orders of Courage. Utkin is one of the creators, owners and commander of the Wagner PMC group. He took part in many military operations around the world, including and in the role of a mercenary of the "Slavic Corps". With the beginning of the event in eastern Ukraine in 2014, he took part in the creation of the PMC "Wagner", the name was derived from his call sign "Wagner", after which the "Wagner Group" he named took part in the battles for Lugansk airport, and then took part in conflicts around the world."
WGN_buyweaponsafrica: "Purchase of Modern Weaponry"
WGN_buyweaponsafrica_desc: "In past campaigns our Musicians had to rely on dated gear: AK-74s, RPG-7s, and aging Soviet APCs. When our enemies re-armed to NATO standards, we were still fighting with Cold-War relics. The notorious ammunition shortage was only a symptom of the deeper problem. Now it is time to correct that blunder. We will equip our fighters with upgraded AK-12s, field a reliable domestic variant of the loitering-SAM drone, mount small arms on UAVs, test true swarm-drone tactics, and build an autonomous, Wagner-controlled logistics chain."

WGN_recruitment: "Veteran Recruitment Drive"
WGN_recruitment_desc: "Everything new is well-forgotten old. Instead of filling fresh units with green conscripts, we will recruit combat-tested veterans—especially for the officer corps—ensuring immediate battlefield effectiveness."

WGN_contractlogistics: "Contract-Based Logistics"
WGN_contractlogistics_desc: "As the ranks swell, order must follow. Service becomes contractual: every fighter signs clear terms, receives fixed pay, insurance, and responsibilities. The structure gains resilience, discipline rises, and overseas management becomes easier."

WGN_training: "Harsh-Environment Training"
WGN_training_desc: "Training follows proven methods: field, sweat, blood. Troops undergo accelerated preparation in live-fire conditions—both at the Molkino base and at forward sites abroad."

WGN_newcontingent: "Assemble a New African Contingent"
WGN_newcontingent_desc: "Given our expanding interests in Africa we are forming a new task-force for the Central African Republic. The detachment will guard the government, secure infrastructure, and clear rebellious districts."

WGN_contractwithmotherland: "Contract with the Motherland"
WGN_contractwithmotherland_desc: "If we are in the game, we need clarity: what we earn, how we work, who answers, and how our experience will help. The Motherland needs us."

WGN_expandcooperation: "Broaden Ties with African Leaders"
WGN_expandcooperation_desc: "Across Africa Wagner helps local governments fight terrorism, separatism, and to guard critical sites. In the CAR we protect state authority, in Mali we replaced French troops and battle Azawad rebels. Now we can go further: along with combating jihadists we will train local forces to our standards in exchange for access to mineral wealth—an offer too lucrative to refuse."

WGN_newcontracts: "Negotiate Improved Contract Terms"
WGN_newcontracts_desc: "Until now Wagner was little admired at home: regular forces were paid handsomely while our fighters saw low, sporadic wages and poor gear. That changes today—we will raise and stabilize pay, introduce pensions and insurance, and finally issue modern equipment."

WGN_africanoperations: "African Operations"
WGN_africanoperations_desc: "In Africa we prove our worth. Under the guise of ‘advisers’ our men conduct sweeps, escort convoys, and secure resources. An invisible yet vicious struggle for regional influence is under way."

WGN_buyweapons: "Armament Procurement Campaigns"
WGN_buyweapons_desc: "Ambitious goals demand a solid materiel base. We will run large-scale drives to acquire cutting-edge arms and ample munitions."

WGN_expansionminingcapacities: "Expand Mining Capacities"
WGN_expansionminingcapacities_desc: "Leveraging deals with African governments, we enter gold, diamond, and oil extraction. These resources will anchor and boost our financial independence."

WGN_modrfcooperation: "Emergency General-Staff Call"
WGN_modrfcooperation_desc: "A call from the very top—urgent. They need our support. Now we must decide on what terms we intervene and which tasks await us."

WGN_convenecouncil: "Convene the Wagner Command Council"
WGN_convenecouncil_desc: "The day we have awaited has dawned. Commanders must gather and choose: do we stay on the sidelines or step onto the stage?"
WGN_setprecisegoals: "Define Precise Objectives for Wagner PMC"
WGN_setprecisegoals_desc: "To fight effectively we must identify priority axes and targets. Wagner will receive clear instructions aimed at achieving rapid strategic results."

WGN_shapinglogistics: "Shape SMO Logistics for Wagner"
WGN_shapinglogistics_desc: "Reliable logistics are the backbone of any operation. We will build a robust supply network to move ammunition, equipment, and rations to the front on time."

WGN_offerassistancetorussia: "Offer Assistance to the Russian Federation"
WGN_offerassistancetorussia_desc: "Russia is beginning to stall. We see where this is heading— perhaps the fighting will spill onto Russian soil. Time to remind them of our strength and Syrian experience: we will offer the support of our Musicians."

WGN_suppliesfrommdrf: "Deliveries from the MOD"
WGN_suppliesfrommdrf_desc: "The Ministry of Defense backs us with shipments of gear, weapons, and uniforms, reinforcing our front-line units."

WGN_internalaffairs: "Internal Policy of Wagner PMC"
WGN_internalaffairs_desc: "Field improvisation is over—now we codify order. We create our own hierarchy, discipline, and charter, answerable to neither the MOD nor outside forces. Loyalty, combat record, and a will to sacrifice—these are our filters. Real power is order built on blood and fear."

WGN_materialsupport: "Material Support for the PMC"
WGN_materialsupport_desc: "Victory requires steady material flow. We will secure funding, equipment deliveries, and full provisioning for every detachment."

WGN_buydrones: "Procure Modern Drones"
WGN_buydrones_desc: "Technological edge wins wars. Investing in state-of-the-art UAVs will boost our reconnaissance, fire-correction, and precision-strike capability."

WGN_buysattelites: "Purchase Chinese Satellites"
WGN_buysattelites_desc: "Advanced satellite reconnaissance will grant us tactical superiority. Chinese orbital assets will greatly improve our awareness of enemy movements."

WGN_agreementwiththegovernmentvolunteerrecruitment: "Nation-Wide Volunteer Recruitment Accord"
WGN_agreementwiththegovernmentvolunteerrecruitment_desc: "Since spring 2022 we have been enlisting volunteers, but coverage was narrow. Today is historic—we gain official permission for nation-wide recruiting. Billboards, VK, Telegram: a volunteer may be 20 or 40, fresh from the army or family life—now we can reach them all, just like the MOD."

WGN_recruitmentcentresinrussia: "Regional Recruitment Centers"
WGN_recruitmentcentresinrussia_desc: "We will open enlistment hubs across every major Russian city. A volunteer need only bring papers, pass a check, and travel to our base. No more buying tickets to Molkino only to be rejected—centers remove that barrier."

WGN_recruitmentofforeignvolunteers: "Recruit Foreign Volunteers"
WGN_recruitmentofforeignvolunteers_desc: "They fear us beyond these borders. From Africa, Latin America, Europe—those seeking not just war but purpose come to us. They want goals, money, an enemy—no flags. The Wagner International Legion will give them all of it."

WGN_newbattlefieldenvironment: "New Battlefield Environment"
WGN_newbattlefieldenvironment_desc: "Our fighters are among the best, versed in deserts, jungles, mountains—but not in large-scale conventional war. Ukraine’s plains and forests demand new drills. We will train old and new units on flat and wooded terrain to raise effectiveness against the UAF."

WGN_optimalwarfightingstrategy: "Draft an Optimal Combat Strategy"
WGN_optimalwarfightingstrategy_desc: "To counter Ukraine’s own tactics we must craft or select a strategy. All Wagner chiefs will meet, review doctrines, and choose the one that fits us best."

WGN_encirclementattacktactics: "Double-Envelopment Tactic"
WGN_encirclementattacktactics_desc: "After debate we chose the classic double-envelopment: two mobile groups strike both flanks, synchronizing to trap the enemy. From the 14th century on, armies using this manoeuvre have prevailed—we shall too."

WGN_lightningfastcaptureoftheflanks: "Lightning Capture of the Flanks"
WGN_lightningfastcaptureoftheflanks_desc: "Double envelopment worked, but we attacked piecemeal, letting the enemy shift reserves. We will now launch a synchronized wave along the entire front, denying the opponent any chance to redeploy."

WGN_tacticsofthefiringshaft: "Rolling Barrage Tactic"
WGN_tacticsofthefiringshaft_desc: "A rolling barrage lays an unbroken curtain of shell bursts ahead of advancing troops, inching forward as they move. Ideal for breaching layered defenses like Donbas. Simple and lethal—but it demands vast stocks of guns and shells, which the MOD will provide."
WGN_approvalofoptimaltacticsforwar: "Approve the Optimal War Tactic"
WGN_approvalofoptimaltacticsforwar_desc: "After carefully crafting several approaches it is time to lock-in the final strategy for the war against Ukraine."

WGN_expansionofthecontingent: "Expand the Wagner Contingent"
WGN_expansionofthecontingent_desc: "In the Ukrainian conflict an enlarged Wagner force is vital. Bigger numbers and stronger units let us react quickly, support regular troops, raise training standards, purchase modern arms, and form fresh battalions for large-scale tasks. A broader contingent gives us the flexibility and mobility needed for victory."

WGN_expandthestormingcorps: "Broaden the Assault Corps"
WGN_expandthestormingcorps_desc: "Our assault teams are the wedge that pierces the enemy’s heart. A wedge must be sharp and heavy. We recruit seasoned fighters, add fresh blood, old methods—men who know how to storm without waiting for orders."

WGN_formationoftankbrigades: "Create Tank Brigades"
WGN_formationoftankbrigades_desc: "Infantry can seize a point; artillery can erase it. We need our own armor, our own crews. Every vehicle is an argument, every column a challenge. We will forge an armored fist able to smash any defense—no permission asked."

WGN_formationofartillerybrigades: "Raise Artillery Battalions"
WGN_formationofartillerybrigades_desc: "Wheels and tracks will crush the foe. Mortars, howitzers, MRLs—on our coordinates metal will fall. No long approvals, no ‘sign-offs from above.’ If needed we level it—fast, precise, emotionless."

WGN_extrememeasures: "§RExtreme Measures§!"
WGN_extrememeasures_desc: "Manpower is critically low. A massive new recruiting drive is unavoidable to keep Wagner combat-ready and our operations running."

WGN_umbrellaproject: "§YProject§! “§RUmbrella§!”"
WGN_umbrellaproject_desc: "With shortages we consider every source. Chronically ill volunteers kept in reserve lists will now form separate brigades—identified by special bracelets. They need unique care, but their resolve is iron: nothing to lose, everything to give their families. Training equals regular cadres; the Umbrella project proves even the ‘unfit’ have their right to fight."

WGN_kproject: "§YProject§! “§RK§!”"
WGN_kproject_desc: "State approval lets us tap prison labor. Inmates are hardy, undemanding, and expendable—ideal for our aims. We will drill them into new battalions, throwing them to the front line in exchange for the one thing they crave—hope of freedom. Six-month contracts begin; future steps decided by Wagner’s commanders. ‘K’ dog-tags roll off the press."

WGN_ownmedals: "Institute Wagner Medals"
WGN_ownmedals_desc: "State awards are for parade soldiers. We mint our own—for loyalty, for raids, for the last bullet. Metal that marks belonging to a new warrior elite, earned only through hell."

WGN_thebestchoice: "We Are the Best Choice!"
WGN_thebestchoice_desc: "Citizens can join many volunteer units or sign with the MoD—but Wagner attracts the most. We are Russia’s honor and doctrinal innovators, fighting worldwide. Our artillery answers in seconds, wages never lag, recovery is assured. While countless BARS and Redut units stagnate, Wagnerites—guardians, heroes, Palmira liberators—carry Russia’s banner."

WGN_privatecemeteries: "Private Wagner Cemeteries"
WGN_privatecemeteries_desc: "We bury our own without state permission. No fanfare, but with honor. These plots are our memory and a warning: each who fought for us rests among his own. Enemies are not welcome."

WGN_memorialcomplexes: "Memorial Complexes"
WGN_memorialcomplexes_desc: "No ‘Immortal Regiments’ for us—only concrete, steel, and silence. We build monuments to those who fell. Not places of mourning, but of power where new fighters steel their will."

WGN_planningofmilitaryoperations: "Joint Operational Planning with the MoD"
WGN_planningofmilitaryoperations_desc: "Ministry ties grant strategic cover and resources. We remain independent yet play by the rules when useful. Operations will be coordinated as long as interests align."

WGN_expandairforcecooperation: "Broaden Cooperation with the VKS"
WGN_expandairforcecooperation_desc: "Air support decides battles before we pull triggers. Joint strikes with the Aerospace Forces will smash the enemy’s rear and convoys—eyes in the sky, edge on the ground."

WGN_expandarmycooperation: "Deepen Cooperation with the Armed Forces"
WGN_expandarmycooperation_desc: "Joint drills, intel sharing, tactical integration—Wagner becomes part of a hybrid war machine. Power lies in synchronized assault; we move as one organism hungry for victory."

WGN_informationwar: "Wagner Information War"
WGN_informationwar_desc: "We launch a massive media offensive to cement Wagner as the force defending national interests worldwide. Through media and socials we craft the legend."

WGN_bestpmc: "The World’s Finest PMC"
WGN_bestpmc_desc: "After numerous victories and active promotion Wagner secures a reputation as the most effective and fearsome private military formation on Earth."

WGN_adcompany: "Wagner Advertising Campaign"
WGN_adcompany_desc: "A strong PR drive will attract recruits, burnish our image, and spread the message of our strength and professionalism."

WGN_symbolicadcompany: "Spread the ‘Musicians’ Symbolism"
WGN_symbolicadcompany_desc: "We boost brand recognition by pushing Wagner symbols and merchandise globally—motivating supporters, intimidating foes."

WGN_expandpatriotmediaholding_desc: "The Patriot Agency is our main influence tool. We increase staff, budgets, and reach."

WGN_trollfactoryexpansion_desc: "On the cyber-front we scale up troll-farm capacity—key for swaying hostile publics."

WGN_interactionwithbloggers: "Broaden Cooperation with Bloggers"
WGN_interactionwithbloggers_desc: "We build a network of friendly bloggers to push our narratives. Through collabs, funding, and scripts we amplify influence via ‘independent’ voices."

WGN_continuousstorming: "Continuous Storming"
WGN_continuousstorming_desc: "With ample men and munitions we can grind the enemy. We will launch coordinated assaults across the front; where resistance stiffens waves keep coming, exposing UAF positions for artillery and fresh troops."

WGN_greatorchestra: "The True ‘Orchestra’"
WGN_greatorchestra_desc: "Time to move from symbol to substance. We create a professional structure—hidden yet powerful—uniting military, media, and cultural assets. A genuine Orchestra playing the symphony of war."
WGN_shell_starvation: "Shell Hunger"
WGN_shell_starvation_desc: "With our ranks swelling, ammunition demand has soared—yet, for some reason, the Ministry of Defence refuses to cover it fully, despite vast depots and our front-line successes. We know exactly what kind of people sit atop the Russian Army and how they dream of putting us on a leash. We must not let it happen!"

WGN_troops_withdrawal: "Withdraw from the SMO Zone"
WGN_troops_withdrawal_desc: "Enough mockery from Moscow. If they will not give us shells, we quit the battlefield. There is no point in bleeding men when the only thing missing is ammunition. We pull out."

WGN_continue_the_battle: "We Will Hold the Line!"
WGN_continue_the_battle_desc: "At the hardest hour the MoD decided to play games, starving us of rounds. Very well—if they want a struggle, they will have it."

WGN_fight_against_military_bureaucracy: "Fight the ‘Military Bureaucracy’"
WGN_fight_against_military_bureaucracy_desc: "The rear-echelon clerks envy our victories while they flee their own positions. They sip French wine bought with stolen money and plan to starve our troops of shells. We cannot allow the blood-letting to continue—we must stop them!"

WGN_military_improvisation: "Military Improvisation"

WGN_loyalist_help: "Aid from Our Loyalists"

WGN_never_give_up: "Blood, Honour, Justice, Motherland, Courage"

WGN_defamation: "Discredit the Russian MoD"
WGN_defamation_desc: "The MoD is a cabal of cowards and leeches getting rich on Russian soldiers and war. The public must know: while the country fights a brutal war these bureaucrats play games with us. Let the people see the MoD for what it is."

WGN_oligarch_war: "‘A War for the Oligarchs’"
WGN_oligarch_war_desc: "Claims that the SMO was forced by Kyiv’s plans are lies. The war was launched so a handful of oligarch-bureaucrats could further plunder the army, caring nothing for dead soldiers and craving only stuffed pockets."

WGN_appeal: "Appeal to the Ministry of Defence"

WGN_appeal_to_putin: "Appeal to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief"
WGN_appeal_to_putin_desc: "It is clear President Putin is deceived like ordinary citizens. What lands on his desk and what happens at the front are worlds apart. He may not even know we lack shells. We must reach him and open his eyes by any means—awareness is the first step to solving this crisis."
