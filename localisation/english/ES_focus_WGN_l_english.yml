WGN_newbattlefieldenvironment_desc: "Our soldiers are, if not the best in the world, then at least among the best. They fought in all conditions: in forests, in swamps, in the mountains and, of course, in deserts. But our soldiers have no experience of a large-scale war, which is the war in Ukraine. Also, our troops have long lost their experience of war in plains and forests. And since the entire territory of Ukraine consists of plains and forests, we need to conduct training of old and new fighters of our units on plains and forested terrain to increase the effectiveness of combat with the Ukrainian army."
WGN_optimalwarfightingstrategy: "Development of an optimal strategy for conducting military operations"
WGN_optimalwarfightingstrategy_desc: "In order to effectively conduct military operations with the Ukrainian side, which has its own tactics of conducting combat, we need to develop an individual strategy of conducting combat or choose something from the existing ones. We will gather all the heads of the PMC "Wagner" and hold a meeting, at which we will consider various tactics and choose the one that suits us best."
WGN_encirclementattacktactics: "Tactics "Double Encirclement""
WGN_encirclementattacktactics_desc: "After a long meeting, we settled on the tactics of "Double Encirclement" - This is one of the basic elements of military strategy, used in many wars. The envelopment maneuver ("pincers") is performed by two mobile groups of troops, which simultaneously envelop both flanks of the troops of a less mobile enemy. Special attention is paid to the synchronization of the actions of the enveloping troops. As a result of a successful envelopment, enemy forces can be surrounded. Since the 14th century, countries have used this tactic in wars, which almost always brought them success. Looking at them, we understand that this tactic is the best of the remaining ones."
WGN_lightningfastcaptureoftheflanks: "Lightning Fast Capture of the Flanks"
WGN_lightningfastcaptureoftheflanks_desc: "The "Double Envelopment" tactic has proven its effectiveness in battles with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and we need to realize the potential of this tactic. From the very beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, using this tactic, we fought in small numbers, which allowed the enemy to bring in reinforcements from those places where there was no fighting. To solve this problem, we will launch a planned offensive wave using the "Double Capture" tactic, covering the entire front, which will not allow the enemy to transfer reinforcements from the front sections"
WGN_tacticsofthefiringshaft: "Firewall Tactics"
WGN_tacticsofthefiringshaft_desc: ""Firewall" or Mobile Barrage Fire is an artillery tactical technique widely used in direct fire support of advancing troops. The technique consists of creating and maintaining a continuous fire curtain of artillery shell bursts in front of the attacking units, which consistently moves forward as the offensive develops. As a rule, a firewall is used to break through the enemy's prepared and echeloned defense, which is filled with communication trenches and firing points, which are scattered throughout the Donbass. The type and depth of the barrage are determined by the enemy's defensive fortifications, terrain, and the amount of artillery and ammunition available to the attacker. This tactic is famous for its ease of use and effective results. But the downside of this tactic is that for effective use of this tactic"

New resources will be directed to strengthening the training of fighters, acquiring modern weapons and military equipment, as well as conducting special operations in key areas. An important part of this process will be the formation of new battalions capable of carrying out large-scale combat missions. The expansion of the Wagner PMC contingent will provide us with the flexibility and mobility necessary to achieve victory in the conflict with Ukraine."
