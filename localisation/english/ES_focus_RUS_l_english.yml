RUS_Reduce_the_draft_age_desc: "Military conscription is quite a delicate issue for our state. Conscription familiar to the average Russian appeared relatively recently, since the Soviet era. Yeltsin wanted to change the army mechanism, but escalation of regional conflicts led to the curtailment of reforms. Thus, the familiar 'one year service' appeared only in 2008, within Putin's reforms. It seemed that in the 2010s Russia would move completely to a contract basis. However, bloc thinking dating back to the 'Cold War' contributed to the formation of the army mechanism. NATO expansion threatens Russia's very existence. The RF Ministry of Defense conducted structural changes to varying degrees, but before the SMO began they were too insignificant. Conscription, unfortunately, is not a single well-tuned mechanism. From 'regimental bullying' to an adequate unit, from constant training and practice to questionable experiments with collective responsibility on the parade ground. Every 'conscript' speaks differently about service, as do many 'contract soldiers'. Differences between military units are a barrier to establishing a unified standard. It is obvious that the main goal of conscription is to create a basic pool of personnel for the conscript's specialty. This goal must be fully realized without any deviations. Raising the conscription age to 30 years, standardizing military training, replacing old weapons - all this will allow using a conscript as a full combat unit. We must be confident that in an extreme case, it is the 'conscript' who will replace the 'contract soldier' within their specialty. The military training program will be expanded to 2 years."
