#Events
blrref.0.t: "Choice of the Third Constitution Plan"
blrref.0.d: "Before the referendum, we face the task of choosing which constitution plan the citizens of our country will follow.\nThis is an important decision that will help strengthen our government and gain more support from various legal and judicial bodies."
blrref.0.a: "First Constitution Plan"
blrref.0.b: "Second Constitution Plan"
blrref.0.c: "Merger of the Two Constitution Plans"

blrref.1.t: "Census Question for Presidential Election Candidates"
blrref.1.d: "Some presidential candidates are facing issues. We may introduce restrictions for presidential election participants to exclude incompetent or weak candidates. There's also the option to remove restrictions for the election."
blrref.1.a: "Increase in Residency Requirement"
blrref.1.b: "Increase in Age Requirement"
blrref.1.c: "Increase in Both Residency and Age Requirements"
blrref.1.e: "Remove the Requirement"

blrref.2.t: "All-Belarusian People's Assembly Question"
blrref.2.d: "We must not forget the mistakes of the previous cabinet members of the people's assembly. The cabinet will need to be updated regardless. However, we should consider how we want to approach this overall. We can maintain the current powers of the cabinet and update it by adding more competent new members while keeping the previous members of the assembly. Or we can completely rebuild it with new powers and replace all the assembly members with new ones."
blrref.2.a: "Preserve and Update the Cabinet"
blrref.2.b: "Rebuild the Cabinet"

blrref.3.t: "Presidential Legislative Powers Question"
blrref.3.d: "Most presidents often use legislative powers for their own purposes. Finally, we can put an end to this and introduce limitations on implementing changes and revisions, or leave everything as it is, since the president knows best how to use these functions."
blrref.3.a: "Limit"
blrref.3.b: "Leave as is"
blrref.4.t: "National Assembly Term"
blrref.4.d: "After polling members of the national assembly, we found that some demand an extension of the assembly’s term, while others want a reduction to two years. Some are indifferent and ask for no changes. It’s time to decide on the national assembly's term. We can keep it as it is with a four-year term, extend it to five years, or reduce it to two years."
blrref.4.a: "Extend to 5 years"
blrref.4.b: "Keep at 4 years"
blrref.4.c: "Reduce to 2 years"

blrref.5.t: "Expansion of Powers"
blrref.5.d: "The question of expanding powers has also arisen. Expanding powers will help the person holding the position better control the country or the processes occurring in the country. We can expand the powers of the President of the Republic, or of the Prime Minister."
blrref.5.a: "Expand Powers of the President"
blrref.5.b: "Expand Powers of the Prime Minister"

blrref.6.t: "Human Rights Ombudsman Institute"
blrref.6.d: "The Human Rights Institute will help us integrate into the global human rights community. Most analysts also believe that our republic needs specialists in this field. However, most advisors think this is a foolish idea that will not pay for itself."
blrref.6.a: "Create the Institute"
blrref.6.b: "Reject This Foolish Idea"

blrref.7.t: "Marriage Question"
blrref.7.d: "This issue should also be raised in the decision-making process.\nWe can leave everything as it is now, or declare that 'Marriage is the Union of a Woman and a Man.'"
blrref.7.a: "Traditional Values"
blrref.7.b: "'Marriage is the Union of a Woman and a Man'"

blrref.8.t: "Government After the President’s Violent Death"
blrref.8.d: "Looking at other governments around the world, we understand there’s a chance the president may not survive to the end of their term due to violent death. In such a case, the Security Council would convene to decide who will lead the state or determine the country’s next course. We now have to decide who, in the event of the president’s death, will lead the Security Council: the Prime Minister or the Chairman of the Council of the Republic."
blrref.8.a: "Security Council Led by Chairman of the Council of the Republic"
blrref.8.b: "Security Council Led by Prime Minister"

blrref.9.t: "Holding the President Accountable After Their Resignation"
blrref.9.d: "It is no secret that the president has immunity, and some violations go unpunished. Naturally, these violations are not too serious, and punishing a president during their term would resemble a revolution. In this case, we can introduce a special law to hold the president accountable after their resignation. This would help create a more stable situation within the government."
blrref.9.a: "Hold Them Accountable"
blrref.9.b: "Do Not Hold Them Accountable"

blrref.10.t: "Post-Presidential Position"
blrref.10.d: "One possible solution that requires a decision is providing the president with the option of choosing a new position after leaving office. Given that the president has qualifications and experience in various fields, we can offer several options. Of course, the president may decline this opportunity and choose the civilian sphere. Some possible posts we could offer include a military position or a seat in the Council of the Republic."
blrref.10.a: "President in the Council of the Republic After Presidency"
blrref.10.b: "President in the Army After Presidency"
blrref.10.c: "President Outside Any Position"

blrref.11.t: "Presidential Term"
blrref.11.d: "Since we’ve started the process of reforms, it’s also important to raise the question of whether the presidential term should be extended or reduced. This could help maintain a stronger leader in office or, conversely, remove a weak one in favor of a stronger one."
blrref.11.a: "2 Years"
blrref.11.b: "4 Years"
blrref.11.c: "Leave As Is"

blrref.12.t: "Nuclear Energy Question"
blrref.12.d: "Finally, we’ve reached the production capacity for the development of nuclear energy and the choice of its direction. Developing a single industry will be much more efficient than developing both simultaneously, but in the future, this will greatly strengthen both our economy and military."
blrref.12.a: "Develop Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes"
blrref.12.b: "Develop Nuclear Energy for Military Purposes"
blrref.12.c: "Develop Nuclear Energy for Both Purposes"

blrref.13.t: "Nuclear Energy Question"
blrref.13.d: "After the dissolution of the USSR, our government has always maintained a poor neutral policy. Most people do not want our country to participate in any conflicts and believe that the government is acting correctly and without mistakes. However, we understand that our policy needs change or even a complete abandonment of neutrality, which is the path to a new and strong Belarus."
blrref.13.a: "No More Neutrality"
blrref.13.b: "Continue Neutral Policy"
blrref.13.c: "Expand Neutral Policy"

blrref.14.t: "Expansion of KGB Powers"
blrref.14.d: "The KGB is our country's agency that has always protected our citizens and the country from both internal and external threats. It is now time to determine the main focus of the KGB and to expand its department. We can focus the department's resources on foreign intelligence, which will help us always be prepared for potential threats. Alternatively, we could focus on counterintelligence and allocate more resources and time to it, which would help protect our citizens and government. No one can roam on our land without permission."
blrref.14.a: "Counterintelligence"
blrref.14.b: "Foreign Intelligence"

blrref.15.t: "Referendum Results"
blrref.15.d: "Finally, the outcome: after a long time, we have finished reforming not only our government but also our country as a whole. We have achieved success in various directions and sectors and have set new goals for the development of our country. Undoubtedly, we have not wasted our time and resources. It is time for a new Belarus to take its place on the global stage!"
blrref.15.a: "Accepted!"

blr.1.t: "New Year's Address by the President"
blr.1.d: "Nothing motivates the citizens of our country like the President's New Year address. The President spoke about the fact that the year, like all the previous ones, was difficult, but the country achieved many successes in various areas. While many listen to the speech with a smile, it remains a fact for all citizens of Belarus."
blr.1.a: "Happy New Year!"

blr.2.t: "Talk with Putin"
blr.2.d: "For 4 hours, President of Belarus Lukashenko held negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the moment, it is unknown what the dialogue was about. Most analysts have made various statements in the context of Russian military exercises in areas bordering Ukraine. Our people can only hope that we will not be drawn into the conflict between the two countries. After all, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are brotherly nations."
blr.2.a: "Accepted!"

blr.3.t: "Trial of Grigory Kostusev"
blr.3.d: "The court issued a guilty verdict in the case of an attempted coup in Belarus, as reported by the Telegram channel of the agency. Grigory Kostusev and Alexander Fedut were recently arrested by the KGB of Belarus, and cases against them were sent to the Minsk Court. The result of the trial was the announcement of the sentence for political analysts Grigory Kostusev and Alexander Fedut for their conspiracy to seize power – they were sentenced to 10 years in a high-security colony. Kostusev himself previously noted that he had not consented to participating in the conspiracy and asked the court to consider his serious health condition."
blr.3.a: "Good riddance"

blr.4.t: "Civil War"
blr.4.d: "The morning in our peaceful country began with mass protests, gunfire, and explosions in cities such as Brest, Grodno, Baranovichi, Pinsk, and Minsk. State media announced the start of an internal conflict and urged citizens not to go out on the streets or support the opposition, claiming that they would soon be crushed. In some smaller cities and villages, local police, supported by the KGB, were able to disperse the protesters. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, with reports that the opposition has seized warehouses with light and heavy weapons, and some military units are supporting the potential new government. Videos have already appeared on social media from BChB members calling for armed resistance and highlighting the inability of the current government to handle the situation. By the evening of the same day, videos emerged showing BChB militants using light and heavy equipment, breaking through columns of military and police in urban areas. Lukashenko has not yet commented on the start of civil war, and many believe he has already left the country and is heading to Russia. The press secretary stated that the President is in a security meeting. The situation is very complicated and worrying. Lord, protect Belarus."
blr.4.a: "For the Red Homeland!"
blr.4.b: "Enemies must be destroyed..."

#Decisions
BLR_influence_category: "Influence on Belarus"
BLR_influence_category_gui: "Belarus is in close proximity to Russia's heart - Moscow. It also shares a border of over 800 km. Russia is not ready to let such a country fall into NATO's hands. However, it is far more advantageous for Belarus to rid itself of any foreign influence. NATO, on the other hand, is ready to sponsor the opposition up to and including revolution."

BLR_influence_less_then: "Our influence is less than §G25%§!"
BLR_RUS_Union: "Union State"
BLR_RUS_Union_gui: "Throughout history, Russia and Belarus have been brothers. Today, both countries are going through tough times. Opposition backed by the West is gaining strength in Belarus. Russia has taken the last step for its survival by announcing a special military operation in Ukraine. Therefore, the idea of creating a Union State between Russia and Belarus is gaining traction."
