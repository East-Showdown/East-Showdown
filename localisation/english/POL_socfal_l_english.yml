pol_f.1.d: "With the new government in power, Warsaw's streets glow once again with torch-lit parades. Newspapers trumpet the slogan of a “national dawn,” and schools introduce a brand-new history course."
pol_f.1.a: "Very well."

pol_f.2.t: "An Offer to Orbán"
pol_f.2.d: "The foreign minister reports that Budapest has received a cable from Warsaw proposing to Viktor Orbán the creation of a “Crusader Bloc” — a Catholic and nationalist axis of Europe to stand against Brussels bureaucrats and the “Atlantic diktat.”"

pol_f.4.a: "This is bad."

pol_f.5.t: "Lviv — or War"
pol_f.5.d: "Radio broadcasts a historic manifesto: “Lviv is the cradle of Polish culture; Ukraine holds it illegally.” Warsaw issues Kyiv an ultimatum: peaceful demarcation of the eastern border or the issue will be settled by force. The General Staff evaluates operations and masses tank brigades near Przemyśl."
pol_f.5.a: "We will give the Poles a fight!"

pol_f.6.t: "Ukraine Stands Firm"

pol_f_news.6.t: "Poland Tightens Policy toward Ukraine"
pol_f_news.6.d: "The Falangist Sejm has imposed tariffs on Ukrainian grain, suspended arms transit without Polish oversight, and demanded restitution of Polish monuments in Lviv. Kyiv calls it ‘blackmail’, while US diplomats scramble to cool tensions along the Bug and San."
pol_f_news.6.a: "Very loud news."
pol_f_news.6.b: "Ukrainians must back down."

pol_f_news.7.t: "A New Intermarium"
