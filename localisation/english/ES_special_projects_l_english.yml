 sp_RUS_rocket_artillery_modernization_desc: "Modernizing MLRS systems based on experience gained in the Special Military Operation zone is a critical task, without which the army will be significantly inferior to the enemy in delivering high-precision strikes against rear-area targets and troop concentrations. The primary method for modernizing multiple launch rocket systems is considered to be the transition to projectiles guided by satellite navigation systems and the automation of fire control systems to reduce circular error and increase the launch range of ammunition. Work is also underway to closely integrate them with reconnaissance UAVs and counter-battery reconnaissance radars for rapid target designation and fire adjustment. Improvements will specifically affect the Tornado-S missile systems, but systems such as the Grad and Smerch will also receive modernization packages, introducing guided 300-mm projectiles and electronic warfare-resistant communication channels."
