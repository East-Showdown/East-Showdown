# NATO
nato_legacy: "Deep Operations with Unrestricted Air Support"
nato_legacy_desc: "NATO doctrine emphasizes rapid penetration into enemy defenses by collapsing their organized resistance. Key factors include absolute air and aerospace reconnaissance superiority, ensuring continuous communication, awareness, cover, and precision strikes on key targets deep behind enemy lines. Precise planning, rational execution, and operational efficiency are the foundation of success."
no_one_left_behind: "No One Left Behind"
no_one_left_behind_desc: "A sacred principle of the democratic world focused on preserving the lives of its servicemen. Every wounded soldier will be evacuated from the battlefield at any cost, even if it slows the offensive. An advanced medevac system, modern field hospitals, and psychological support form the basis of morale and the soldier’s confidence that they won’t be abandoned."
top_notch_equipment: "Top-Notch Equipment"
top_notch_equipment_desc: "Western forces are equipped with the best weapons and gear in the world: digital communication systems, thermal imagers and night vision devices, UAVs, and precision-guided munitions. This provides a tactical edge, but such advanced technology is expensive to produce, requires skilled maintenance, and is vulnerable to jamming, malfunctions, or enemy capture."
us_marine_corps: "Navy SEALs"
us_marine_corps_desc: "Navy SEALs are the elite of the U.S. Marine Corps, mirrored by similar units across NATO countries. Masters of covert operations—raids, sabotage, hostage rescues, and strategic takeovers. Their strength lies in exceptional training and the ability to operate autonomously in any environment (sea, land, air), delivering devastating blows to enemy forces."
overreliance_on_air_superiority: "Development of the 'AirLand Battle' Doctrine"
overreliance_on_air_superiority_desc: "A 1980s doctrine emphasizing air superiority over artillery. It focuses on giving air units operational freedom, inter-branch coordination, and precision strikes on enemy concentrations. Its main goal is to outpace the enemy in decision-making and execution, disrupt logistics and command, and avoid frontal engagements until full battlefield dominance is achieved."
# USSR
ussr_legacy: "‘Seven Days to the Rhine’"
ussr_legacy_desc: "One of the core principles of warfare in post-Soviet militaries is speed and maneuverability. The faster territory is captured and troops advance, the more likely the war will be swift and victorious."
massed_artillery: "‘Artillery is the God of War!’"
massed_artillery_desc: "For over six centuries, artillery has been the decisive weapon in most wars and battles. It has caused more casualties than any other weapon and serves many purposes: suppressing enemy infantry, destroying vehicles, obliterating strongpoints, and more. For all this, artillery is rightfully known as the 'God of War.'"
over_mechanized: "Overmechanization"
over_mechanized_desc: "In the 21st century, mechanization ranks among the top priorities of military logistics. Vehicles enable fast assaults, frontline and rear mobility, and devastating firepower while providing protection from small arms and many missile systems. The greater the mechanization, the sooner victory comes."
vdv_cult: "VDV Cult"
vdv_cult_desc: "Since their founding, the 'Uncle Vasya’s Troops' (VDV) have been revered as the most elite forces in any post-Soviet army. Renowned for their morale, they fight to the last man, fearlessly dive into the fiercest battles, and never retreat—no matter how desperate the situation."
dysfunctional_general_staff: "Bloated and Inflexible General Staff"
dysfunctional_general_staff_desc: "Command structures are overloaded with excess personnel, burdensome bureaucracy, and outdated decision-making procedures. This results in sluggish operational response, poor coordination between units, and a limited ability to adapt to rapidly changing conditions on the battlefield."
# ATO
ato_oos_legacy: "Evolution of Flexible Defense"
ato_oos_legacy_desc: "The war in Donbas significantly influenced doctrinal development. A shortage of manpower, supplies, equipment, and officers forced the adoption of a flexible, resource-driven defensive strategy. Battlefield gains are temporary, and trophies change hands constantly. The widespread use of Soviet-era ammunition became a norm. It's hard to advance — but easy to entrench. That says it all."
experienced_artillerists: "Nomadic Fire Units"
experienced_artillerists_desc: "Soviet-era artillery doctrines are no longer viable due to insufficient firepower. Cluster munitions, recon-sabotage teams, and counter-battery warfare have led to widespread use of shoot-and-scoot tactics. Each gun operates under individual orders from higher command, allowing units to minimize exposure and survive in a hostile environment."
alternative_tank_application: "Indirect Tank Fire"
alternative_tank_application_desc: "Indirect tank fire—firing from covered positions at targets outside direct line of sight using external observers—has become a necessity. Soviet manuals from 1964 and 1970 addressed the theoretical foundations and crew training. However, experimental tests have shown the limited effectiveness of such fire in practice."
experienced_assault_infantry: "Experienced Strongpoint Assault Troops"
experienced_assault_infantry_desc: "The People's Militias of the Donetsk and Luhansk Republics (DPR/LPR) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces gained unparalleled experience in storming fortified positions—something that couldn’t be learned in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Chechnya. This prolonged conflict, blending new technologies with the remnants of Soviet military theory, forced all sides to refine coordination and strip down doctrine to its most effective essentials."
widespread_fpv_drone_usage: "Use of Civilian FPV Drones"
widespread_fpv_drone_usage_desc: "The war in Donbas became unique in its use of drones. Chinese components now fly in the skies on both sides alongside military-grade models. The initiative came from low-ranking troops who began independently purchasing UAVs. By 2022, drone use had increased exponentially. Surveillance, targeting, direct strikes—all can be performed without risking the operator. In the face of manpower shortages, this shift became foundational."
