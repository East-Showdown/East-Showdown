rus.1.t: "The SMO Is Dragging On"
rus.1.desc: "Despite our clear victories at the front, the Ukrainian army is in no hurry to surrender. We have achieved most of our military-tactical goals, taken many settlements, and destroyed vast quantities of Ukrainian equipment and aircraft—yet things are not quite going to plan. The operation is plainly running long, and our force grouping is beginning to tire. Kyiv seems unlikely to seize the initiative, but the General Staff has serious concerns on that score."
rus.1.a: "Just a little longer…"

rus.2.t: "Death of Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky"
rus.2.desc: "At 13:50 Moscow time on 6 April 2022 Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky—founder and leader of LDPR, State-Duma deputy, presidential candidate in 1991, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018, Deputy Speaker of the Duma (2000-2011), PACE delegate (1996-2008), Doctor of Philosophy, Honoured Lawyer of Russia and full Cavalier of the Order ‘For Merit to the Fatherland’—died of coronavirus. A towering, famous figure, his memory will long linger among the people."
rus.2.a: "He’ll be remembered as a true patriot!"
rus.2.b: "We’ll honour Vladimir Volfych."
rus.2.c: "At last that clown is gone."

rus.8.t: "Opening Situation"
rus.8.desc: "A Russian invasion of Ukraine looms. The pre-history of the coming conflict began back in 2013, when anti-Russian protests swept Ukraine, leading in early 2014 to the proclamation of the DPR and LPR and a full-scale war in Donbas. Active fighting lasted until 2015, while local clashes continued right up to 2022. On one side stands Russia, seeking an industrial, populous Donbas and the protection of Russian-speakers there; on the other stands Ukraine, seeking to restore its territorial integrity and regain Crimea and Donbas. What will the new year bring?"
rus.8.a: "It promises to be interesting"

rus.9.t: "Russia Recognises the DPR and LPR"
rus.9.desc: "President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognising the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and two treaties of friendship and mutual aid. The signing took place in the Kremlin’s St Catherine Hall after an expanded Security-Council session. The republics’ heads—Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik—signed for the DPR and LPR.\n\nTomorrow the Federation Council’s profile committees and the State Duma will meet to consider recognition."
rus.9.a: "Donbas will be free!"

rus.10.t: "Documents on Recognition Signed"
rus.10.desc: "Same text as above, repeated."
rus.10.a: "Glory to Russia!"

rus.11.t: "Withdrawal from Kyiv"
rus.11.desc: "The Kyiv front remains tense. Over-stretched tails, weak logistics and partisan activity make further offensive action impossible here. The General Staff has decided to pull troops from northern Ukraine and redeploy them elsewhere."
rus.11.a: "This isn’t over yet"
rus.11.b: "A ‘gesture of goodwill’—brilliant!"

rus.12.t: "Hostomel Air Assault"
rus.12.desc: "After long preparation our brave paratroopers are ready to land near Kyiv, seize Hostomel airport and open a supply gate at the capital’s doorstep. They await only the order."
rus.12.a: "Get to work, brothers"

rus.13.t: "Sanctions"
rus.13.desc: "With combat under way, Ukraine’s Western patrons imposed further sanctions atop the existing ones, hitting our economy hard—especially foreign businesses still inside Russia. Even so, we stand firm and will never give in."
rus.13.a: "Wrap that package inside a package"

rus.14.t: "Kyiv Has Fallen!"
rus.14.desc: "Just as many analysts predicted, the Kyiv regime failed to hold the capital: Kyiv, mother of Russian cities, is now under our control! Soon our troops will march in parade across Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Though Nazi resistance battered the city, we prevailed. Our priority now is restoring order and rooting out regime collaborators. President Zelensky and his staff fled before our troops reached Bankova; we will track him down and bring him to justice!"
rus.14.a: "Victory is near!"

rus.15.t: "Street Protests"
rus.15.desc: "After the launch of the SMO unsanctioned anti-war rallies broke out in several Russian cities. Small groups, swayed by Western propaganda, took to the streets. Thousands have been recorded nationwide, largest in Moscow and St Petersburg. Police are on scene and violators are detained.\n\nThe Investigative Committee warned that protesters may face prosecution for unsanctioned actions amid ‘heightened foreign-policy tensions’."
rus.15.a: "Deal with them"

rus.17.t: "Criminal Code Article 280.3"
rus.17.desc: "The President signed amendments introducing criminal liability for ‘discrediting’ or spreading false information about personnel in the SMO—including volunteers—and lengthening prison terms."
rus.17.a: "No more fakes"

rus.18.t: "‘Since Time Immemorial for Truth’"
rus.18.desc: "The Ukraine conflict is an ideological struggle. Our task is to help people grasp its importance and choose a side. For centuries our nation has faced alien ideologues; we must remind citizens how we answered such challenges and draw strength today."
rus.18.a: "Focus on the Great Patriotic War"
rus.18.b: "Focus on Imperial legacy"
rus.18.c: "Focus on facing the West"

rus.19.t: "Ukraine Signs an Act of Capitulation!"
rus.19.desc: "President Zelensky has told Ukrainian troops to cease resistance: today Nazi power in Ukraine is officially broken. Kyiv accepted our terms; Russia reclaimed historic lands and saved Donbas residents from Nazi terror. The West wasted billions arming Ukraine and is now drowning in debt. Glory to Russia!"
rus.19.a: "The Kyiv regime is finished!!!"

rus.21.t: "Landing on Snake Island"
rus.21.desc: "The cruiser Moskva and patrol ship Vasiliy Bykov captured Snake Island, key to dominance of the north-western Black Sea. The garrison at first refused to surrender but, after brief shelling, all 82 border guards laid down arms. The island is under full control, opening prospects for an Odessa landing."
rus.21.a: "Hurrah!"

rus.28.t: "Shell-Hunger"
rus.28.d: "PMC Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin says ammunition shortages have reached 70 %, halting further advance. He blames two men: Shoigu and Gerasimov."
rus.28.n: "Mutiny on a sinking ship…"

rus.30.t: "§R Wagner Group on Top§!"
rus.30.d: "PMC Wagner now wields unrivalled clout in Russia’s military-political scene. Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin enjoys sway in SMO command. Defence-minister Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Gerasimov resent Wagner’s meteoric rise, and the internal feud may hurt results at the front."
rus.30.o: "The army can wait—§RWagner§! is coming."

rus.31.t: "§2Ministry of Defence in Control§!"
rus.31.d: "The MoD continues to consolidate control of military and some political affairs. Shoigu, Gerasimov and other commanders enjoy broad respect among troops and citizens. Prigozhin’s complaints aside, Wagner’s influence is waning."
rus.31.o: "The upstart’s overboard; the army knows its job."

rus.32.t: "Igor Girkin Joins the Armed Forces"
rus.32.d: "Veteran Igor ‘Strelkov’ Girkin will transfer from DNR militia to MoD control. A veteran of Chechnya, Bosnia and early Donbas fighting, Girkin held off Ukrainian advances in 2014 and briefly served as DNR defence minister. With the SMO he returns to uniform."
rus.32.o: "Experienced cadres are welcome"

rus.34.t: "Assassination Attempt on Vladlen Tatarsky"
rus.34.d: "In St Petersburg an attempt was made on war-correspondent Vladlen Tatarsky (Maxim Fomin). During a creative evening a guest, Darya Trepova, gave him a bust containing explosives. At 18:13 it detonated. Tatarsky is hospitalised in stable condition. Trepova faces terrorism charges. Ukraine denies involvement."
rus.34.o: "The terrorist must face the full law!"

rus.35.t: "Vladlen Tatarsky Killed"

rus.36.t: "Tragedy in Izhevsk"
rus.36.d: "A gunman with Nazi symbols stormed Izhevsk School 88 with two modified pistols: 19 dead (including attacker), 23 injured. Shooter Artem Kazantsev, 34, committed suicide. Such incidents rise yearly, sparking debates on gun control and school security."
rus.36.o: "Izhevsk, we’re with you!"

rus.37.t: "Hostomel Airdrop Fails"
rus.37.d: "The assault to seize Antonov airport by VDV collapsed. After initial success heavy losses forced retreat to nearby woods; the group was later wiped out by Ukrainian territorial defence."
rus.37.o: "Our paratroopers’ feat will not be forgotten"

rus.38.t: "Vasylkiv Airdrop Fails"
rus.38.d: "The Vasylkiv airfield operation failed. Most Il-76s were shot down en-route; landed groups near Hlevakha were destroyed by NGU."
rus.38.o: "Their feat will not be forgotten"

rus.39.t: "Kherson Bridge Airdrop Fails"
rus.39.d: "Attempts to seize Dnipro bridges by VDV failed. Mi-8s were downed by MANPADS; landed troops were wiped out by TD and NGU."
rus.39.o: "Their feat will not be forgotten"

rus.40.t: "Berdiansk Amphibious Landing Fails"
rus.40.d: "The Navy’s landing near Berdiansk failed. Several LSTs were hit by Ukrainian UAVs and sank; landed marines were destroyed by TD and NGU."
rus.40.o: "Their feat will not be forgotten"

rus.62.t: "Landing at Antonivsky Bridge"
rus.62.d: "After long prep our airborne will jump near Kherson to secure Antonivsky Bridge and Kakhovka HPP—crucial for crossing the Dnipro. Success will enable the push on Kherson’s right bank. We believe in our paratroopers—forward!"
rus.62.a: "For the Airborne!"

rus.63.t: "HIMARS Strike!"
rus.63.d: "The AFU struck the [?new_himars_shelling.GetName] region with HIMARS supplied by the U.S. and other hostile states. Innocent civilians were hit and there are fatalities."
rus.63.a: "Another fascist crime?"

rus.64.t: "HIMARS Strike!"
rus.64.d: "AFU launched HIMARS rockets at [?new_himars_shelling.GetName], damaging buildings, food depots and killing civilians on Russian-held territory. Tensions rise; no one knows the next moves."
rus.64.a: "Bastards!"

rus.65.t: "HIMARS Strike!"
rus.65.d: "Civilians in [?new_himars_shelling.GetName] came under HIMARS fire, alarming Russia and the world. The General Staff vows to respond, but escalation could mean more victims. International voices call for de-escalation."
rus.65.a: "The fascists never cease to shock…"
rus.66.t: "HIMARS Strike!"
rus.66.d: "Reports indicate that the [?new_himars_shelling.GetName] region—under Russian control—was hit by HIMARS rockets. Many buildings were damaged and civilians killed. Tension inside the Russian Federation is high, and no one is sure how our army will respond. All sides must recognise that violence never brings peace; only dialogue can lead to compromise and a settlement."
rus.66.a: "Scum!"

rus.67.t: "Conscripts at the Front"
rus.67.d: "After the SMO began it emerged that conscript soldiers had been deployed on the front lines. Though the MoD denies this, it is clear they were present in the SMO zone performing guard and logistics duties. If the news reaches the media our image will take a severe hit. We must fix the mistake fast—before any conscript is killed."
rus.67.a: "How could this be allowed?!"

rus.68.t: "Growing Power of Wagner PMC"
rus.68.d: "PMC Wagner continues rapidly expanding its ranks, greatly increasing its manpower and combat strength."

rus.75.t: "Choosing a New Defence Minister"
rus.75.d: "With Shoigu gone we must pick a new minister. Three pools of candidates exist:\n\n• **Security-service veterans (FSB, SOF):** would tighten coordination with intelligence, cut corruption and boost special-forces capability.\n\n• **Defence-industry technocrats:** would optimise spending, speed up re-armament and focus on long war production.\n\n• **Career military (MoD/Genshtab):** field commanders who know the army’s real needs, ensuring stability and effective planning."

rus.71.t: "Wagner Approaches Moscow"
rus.71.d: "Wagner troops draw ever closer: reports place them at defensive lines on the Oka River in Moscow Oblast. The danger of Russians fighting Russians grows; if Prigozhin presses on, it may be the point of no return."

rus.80.t: "Shell-Hunger Resolved"
rus.80.d: "Under the new MoD leadership, and with Gen. Surovikin’s involvement, GSh directive 237/2022 cutting ammo supplies was scrapped. Restrictions on artillery and MLRS rounds are lifted; stockpiles unlocked for the Armed Forces and Wagner to crush the enemy"

rus.83.t: "\"I/WE – WAGNER\""
rus.83.d: "Appeal by Wagner Group head Yevgeny Prigozhin to the people of Russia and the MoD (abridged): “As they say, the crap is boiling, the blood is seething, yet my ammunition questions remain totally unsolved. It’s a gravest problem. Russia has shells, that’s been stated many times. Industry delivers what the country needs—more than enough.I know the depots, batch numbers, crate numbers. I know exactly where everything is. Those munitions exist. But I cannot get them, despite all my contacts. Everything bogs down. No decisions. Generals and officers in the staffs help however they can—sometimes breaking regulations to hand us the extra rounds we desperately need. Officials point upward and say: ‘You know, Yevgeny Viktorovich, your relations up there are difficult.’ They roll their eyes and tell me: go apologise and repent—then your boys get ammo. Apologise to whom? Repent before whom? 140 million Russians—tell me to whom I must apologise so my men die half as often as they do now! I accuse no one. I simply say: drop your whims, forget your principles—give us the ammunition. I won’t poke your noses in the fact you dine off gold plates and send daughters, grand-daughters and lapdogs to Dubai while Russian soldiers die at the front. I just ask—give the shells!”
rus.83.a: "What hysterics!"

rus.100.d: "In a long interview Prigozhin claimed the SMO serves ‘oligarchic profit’, again slandering our government and heroic army. Most of his ‘facts’ are baseless or ripped from context. Time to silence him."
rus.100.a: "Prigozhin is himself an oligarch"

rus.102.t: "\"Shoigu’s son-in-law shakes his buns while our boys come home in zinc…\" — Prigozhin"
rus.102.d: "In an interview with Konstantin Dolgov, Prigozhin crudely trashed the government, Shoigu, Gerasimov, ‘failed’ SMO, ‘huge losses’, gear quality, etc. A ‘chat’ with him is overdue."
rus.102.a: "Will he ever shut up?"

rus.101.t: "Prigozhin Accuses Us of Mining Wagner’s Rear"
rus.101.d: "As Wagner withdraws from the SMO, they claim our prepared exit routes were mined and a lieutenant-colonel captured after firing on a Wagner vehicle. MPs, investigators and FSB are dispatched. Clearly a provocation to stir discontent. What is Yevgeny really planning?"

rus.133.desc: "In July 2014, after the war in Donbas began, the Russian Imperial Movement began training and dispatching volunteers to support the self-proclaimed republics. On this basis the movement’s combat unit—the Imperial Legion—was formed. Its volunteers fought around Sloviansk, Donetsk, Debaltseve, the Mius river and the village of Nikishyne. After the active phase of the war ended, several Legion members worked as mercenaries in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nWith the launch of the Special Military Operation, the movement’s fighters again declared their readiness to oppose Ukraine and defend the people of Donbas. The Legion has begun reorganising and is preparing to deploy to the front as part of the Redut formation."

Today I shall speak not only about our immediate plans but also about strategic tasks—about issues whose resolution I consider fundamentally important for the confident, long-term development of our country.\n\nThis programme of concrete measures has largely taken shape during trips to the regions and direct conversations with workers and engineers at civilian and defence plants, with doctors, teachers, scientists, volunteers, entrepreneurs, large families, our frontline heroes, volunteers, soldiers and officers of the Russian Armed Forces. Of course, we understand such events are prepared in advance, yet people’s real needs inevitably come through in these conversations.

They are tearing up their contracts en masse, while those whose service time has not expired refuse to obey superior orders. So far about fifty such “refuseniks” have been recorded, but if nothing is done the situation may worsen."

rus.151.desc: "The situation with the refuseniks is deteriorating. Several entire platoons have refused to obey Defence Ministry orders, laid down their arms and demanded to go home. Military police are making mass arrests and transporting them to temporary holding centres. A new slang term—“Cargo 500”—has appeared at the front to describe these soldiers. Although relatively few, they seriously undermine organisation and discipline, and the gaps they leave draw ever thinner reserves. We must act immediately before things spiral out of control."

rus.152.t: "The YouTube Blocking Question"
rus.152.desc: "Recently the issue of blocking YouTube has been debated both by officials and ordinary citizens. Ukrainian nationalists use the platform effectively for information warfare with full support from Google staff, and our requests to moderate disinformation are ignored.

The event symbolises the continuity of generations and the unbroken chain of historical eras. Each flag was once Russia’s state symbol, under each victories and achievements were won; their trinity honours centuries of history.

rus.155.t: "The Ideological Question"
rus.155.desc: "Debate over our future political course is becoming ever sharper. The state must define the main ideological line of policy and propaganda, yet pleasing everyone is impossible. Praise Soviet greatness risks alienating nationalists and “turbo-patriots”; swinging the other way risks losing the left. A concept of “common Russian patriotism” could either repel all sides or unite the Russian people in these troubled times.

rus.156.desc: "From day one of the Special Military Operation the world watched neat columns of Russian armour, marked Z and V, crossing Ukraine’s border without resistance. Hour by hour commanders reported new settlements taken, pushing deeper into enemy territory. It seemed the armoured columns would seize Ukraine’s major cities within days without a shot. It proved illusion: once confronted by the AFU our vehicles jammed in traffic and were picked off one by one, unable to retreat in order. One of the General Staff’s main tactics has utterly failed."

rus.157.desc: "During the largest military operation in Europe since WWII, Russian forces crossed the border unopposed, crushed small territorial-defence detachments and liberated a number of towns and major cities. All objectives of Operation “Mongoose Lunge” have been met. Zelensky’s Nazi regime can no longer hold the line and will soon collapse. From this position we are sending Kyiv an ultimatum demanding capitulation. We hope for their voluntary surrender, but if they refuse we will finish the job and destroy the Banderite vermin."

rus.158.t: "The SMO Is Off-Plan"
rus.158.desc: "However successful the first days were, after a month all the shortcomings of command and organisation have become clear. Our troops have failed to achieve all objectives—effectively a failure of Operation “Mongoose Lunge” and of General Staff planning.

rus.182.t: "Forming a New Ukrainian Government"
rus.182.desc: "We must decide on the composition of Ukraine’s interim government. Four main candidates stand out for acting president:\n\nViktor Medvedchuk — statesman and political figure, co-founder of the pro-Russian OPFL party, close to Putin and currently head of Kyiv’s military-civilian administration. The most acceptable option.\n\nYurii Boiko — statesman, OPFL member and Medvedchuk’s right hand. In 2014 we proposed him as governor of Luhansk. He would pursue a more moderate policy, balancing Russia’s and Ukraine’s interests.\n\nViktor Yanukovych — former Ukrainian president, illegally overthrown in the 2014 coup and now in Russia. Pursued balanced but pro-Russian policy. The most legitimate but extremely unpopular in Ukraine.\n\nIllia Kiva — former MP from OPFL, ex-member of the committee on law-enforcement legislation. Left Ukraine for Spain then Russia before the SMO. Has a murky past with Right Sector and fighting in Donbas with the Poltava battalion. Radically opposed to the former Kyiv junta, supports Putin and the “unification” of Ukraine and Russia."

rus.183.t: "The Unification of Novorossiya"
rus.183.desc: "Talk of creating Novorossiya began soon after the founding of the DPR and LPR. The “Union of People’s Republics—Novorossiya” confederation project was adopted on 24 May 2014, forming an SNR Council with three representatives from each side. On 24-25 June the Supreme Soviets delegated 30 deputies each to the future parliament, and DPR PM Alexander Borodai announced the new state would have its own constitution. The second Minsk agreements did not allow for Novorossiya, so the project was frozen.\n\nNow, after Kyiv’s fall, the idea is back. The heads of Donetsk and Luhansk propose reviving the project, including all historic Novorossiya territories liberated during the SMO. An alternative is to incorporate these areas directly into Russia. One thing is clear—the east of Ukraine has a future only with Russia."
rus.183.a: "Form Novorossiya"
rus.183.b: "Eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia"

rus.185.t: "Ukraine Defeated"
rus.185.desc: "The Ukrainian junta is finished. Disarmament of remaining AFU units and resistance detachments continues in some regions, but major combat is over. The original plan did not envisage full occupation, yet during the SMO it became clear this was the only right solution.

The number of patriots wishing to join the fight is impressive, yet increasingly we see dubious characters with ultraright and openly neo-Nazi views. This is not new: such activists fought for the People’s Republics since 2014 but were seldom publicised or condemned.\n\nAdding ambiguity are the movement’s ties to foreign ultraright groups, notably §RAtomwaffen Division§!. AWD militants have trained at Legion facilities since 2015, and in 2020 the Russian cell §RAtomwaffen Rossiya§! was formed under the imperialists. Also worrying are links to the satanic neo-pagan Order of Nine Angles, whose followers are forming the §RAAST§! unit within the Legion.\n\nAll this jars with our rhetoric of fighting Ukrainian neo-Nazism. Still, as long as we keep the radicals under control, there is nothing to fear… Right?"

rus.200.t: "National-Bolsheviks Support the SMO"
rus.200.desc: "The National-Bolshevik party “The Other Russia”, founded by Eduard Limonov, has long taken a radical stance on Ukraine. As early as 1992 Limonov said a Russian-Ukrainian conflict would start over Crimea. The demand to return Crimea, Donbas and Kharkiv to Russia became core party policy well before 2014, so it is unsurprising that during the “Russian Spring” the Nat-Bols played a visible role.\n\nOn 25 February 2014, amid the Crimean events, the party announced the creation of the “Crimean Tourism Lovers’ Society”, posting a questionnaire for volunteers that included “military specialty”. Anti-Kyiv sentiment soon spread across Novorossiya, especially to Donbas and Kharkiv, where party activists arrived from Crimea. Among them were Latvian Nat-Bol Beness Aijo, dubbed “Black Lenin” for fiery speeches in Donetsk, and journalist Rostislav Zhuravlyov, who took part in administration seizures in both Kharkiv and Donetsk. In April 2014 the party held a special “Ukrainian Congress”, and on 6 May—days after the Odessa tragedy—it announced the volunteer movement “Interbrigades”, whose members defended the people’s republics.\n\nWhen our president announced the SMO to protect Donbas, the Nat-Bols greeted it enthusiastically. “The Other Russia” is preparing many volunteers for Ukraine and collecting humanitarian aid. Some activists propose reorganising the Interbrigades as a full volunteer formation within the Russian Armed Forces; a proposal has already gone to the Defence Ministry."

The appeal to the President on whether to recognize the DPR and LPR was decided by a ranked vote in which the option with the most support prevailed. Two draft resolutions were submitted – one from the KPRF and one from United Russia: the latter called for consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while the Communist draft would be sent to the President immediately.\n\n351 deputies backed the Communist proposal, 16 opposed it and one abstained. The United Russia draft received 310 votes.\n\n\"By a majority of votes, Resolution No. 58243-8, ‘On the appeal of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, on the necessity of recognizing the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic,’ is adopted.

The Supreme Commander-in-Chief opens with an overview of the situation in Ukraine since 2014.\n\n\"We have gathered to discuss the current situation in the Donbas.\n\nIn brief, let me remind you how events unfolded there, although you all know this very well; nevertheless, to give a common picture that will help us take the appropriate decisions. After the coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014, part of the country’s population rejected it. Let me stress that it was an unconstitutional and bloody coup, as many innocent people were killed during those events. It was an armed coup – no one disputes that. The citizens who rejected it included those living in Crimea and those who lived and still live in the Donbas.\n\nThe people declared that they were forming two independent republics – the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic. From that moment confrontation between the Kyiv authorities and the inhabitants of those territories began. I should stress that from the outset Russia did everything to resolve all emerging contradictions peacefully, by political means. Nevertheless, Kyiv twice carried out punitive military operations in these territories, and, apparently, we are witnessing an escalation for a third time.\" \n\nOther officials present from various state bodies will later present their views on resolving the crisis in the Donbas."

rus.203.desc: "S. Lavrov: Esteemed Vladimir Vladimirovich, esteemed colleagues!\n\nAs I reported earlier, we assessed the U.S. and NATO responses to our security-guarantee proposals. Our Western colleagues rejected our key initiatives, including a halt to NATO expansion eastward, citing their ‘open-door’ policy and ‘freedom of choice’. They ignore the principle of indivisible security – especially the clause that one state’s security must not be strengthened at the expense of another.\n\nWe have sent letters to Western partners analysing OSCE commitments and the Russia–NATO Founding Act of 1997. We proposed returning NATO’s force posture on its eastern flank to its 1997 configuration, but this too was dismissed. In reply we were told to ‘end the occupation of Crimea’ and withdraw forces from Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. suggested discussing limits on intermediate-range missiles, though they themselves withdrew from the treaty with Russia. They also raised confidence-building measures on military risks and transparency, yet stripped from the broader context.\n\nOur impression is that Western partners try to highlight secondary issues while dodging the main ones – NATO enlargement and force configuration – and link any dialogue to de-escalation around Ukraine.\n\nWe will press ahead, insisting on the integrity of our initiatives. We are ready to discuss the U.S. ideas, but only in the context of answers to the main questions: halting NATO expansion and revising its military presence in Europe.\n\nAt your direction we have forwarded the documents to Washington.

Kozak: Esteemed Vladimir Vladimirovich, esteemed colleagues!\n\nI will not delve into the details of the complex negotiations on the Minsk Agreements, but it is obvious that neither Ukraine nor its Western allies need the Donbas on any terms. Their goal is to freeze the conflict and shift political and economic responsibility – including financial support – onto Russia.\n\nWe spend enormous sums on humanitarian aid to these territories. Yet the Donbas suffers a labour shortage: vacancies exceed registered unemployed by 2.5 times – the result of our measures, including passport issuance, which may run counter to economic goals.\n\nUkraine and the West show no interest in settlement. Any question about returning the Donbas under Kyiv’s control leaves them speechless. They simply fall silent, not knowing what to say.\n\nAs for the Donbas itself, perhaps there is no need to explain the political and economic factors that…\n\nV.

Today a miner was killed by an artillery shell. Over the past night there were more than 40 targeted strikes on pre-selected sites.\n\nAlong the borders of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts are concentrated 59.3 thousand Ukrainian troops, 345 tanks, 2 160 armoured vehicles, 820 artillery pieces and mortars, and 160 multiple-launch rocket systems, including ‘Smerch’. Heavy equipment, contrary to agreements, has returned to positions. Nationalist battalions, poorly controlled by central command, are active, causing sabotage, terrorism and infrastructure bombings.\n\nA particular danger is Zelensky’s statement on restoring Ukraine’s nuclear status. Ukraine retains technology, equipment and specialists to build nuclear weapons and delivery systems such as ‘Tochka-U’. Combined with nationalist activity, this creates an extremely tense situation.\n\nIn the last month escalation has been observed: equipment movements, radio-frequency changes, increased shelling.

These are the ‘red lines’ the President has repeatedly spoken of.\n\nWe face a difficult choice – whether to recognise the independence of the DPR and LPR. The 2008 precedent of recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia shows such decisions save lives and serve as a lesson to NATO. Today the conflict’s scale is greater, yet we know what to expect from the West: sanctions and pressure. Experience shows that over time tensions ease and partners themselves return to dialogue.\n\nAbout 800 thousand Russian citizens live in the DPR and LPR.

Of course, my appeal is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine. I must speak thoroughly and in detail, for the issue is very serious.\n\nThe situation in the Donbas has once again become critical and acute. Today I address you directly not only to assess what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being taken and possible further steps.\n\nI shall begin with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely and completely created by Russia – more precisely, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process began virtually immediately after the 1917 revolution; Lenin and his associates did it in a way extremely harsh toward Russia itself – by separating, tearing away part of its own historical territories. Of course nobody asked the millions of people who lived there.\n\nI blame no one now; the situation in the country then, after the Civil War, was incredibly hard. I merely state the historical fact. As I said, Soviet Ukraine emerged because of Bolshevik policies and, to this day, can rightly be called ‘Vladimir Ilyich Lenin’s Ukraine’. He was its creator and architect. This is fully confirmed by archival documents, including Lenin’s tough directives on the Donbas, which was literally squeezed into Ukraine. Now their ‘grateful descendants’ in Ukraine have demolished Lenin monuments – this they call de-communisation.\n\n§RYou want de-communisation? Fine with us. But do not stop halfway.

Since 1991 it has mechanically copied foreign models, divorced from both history and Ukrainian realities. Political and state institutions have been repeatedly reshaped to suit rapidly formed clans and their selfish interests, which have nothing in common with the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nStable statehood has failed to take root; electoral procedures serve merely as a screen for redistributing power and property among various oligarchic clans.\n\nCorruption, a challenge for many countries, including Russia, has assumed a special character in Ukraine. It has permeated, corroded the entire system. Radicals exploited people’s legitimate discontent, hijacked the protest and in 2014 carried the Maidan to a coup d’état. Those radicals, having seized power, organized persecution and real terror against those who opposed anti-constitutional actions. One cannot recall without horror the tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the Trade Unions House.\n\nHow long can this tragedy continue? How long must it be endured? Russia did everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity, tirelessly striving to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of 17 February 2015, which endorsed the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015. All in vain. Presidents and deputies change, but not the aggressive, nationalist essence of the regime that seized power in Kyiv.\n\n§RIn this regard I deem it necessary to make a long-overdue decision – to recognize immediately the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic.§!”"

In recent weeks we have had several phone conversations, as you reminded. Despite the crisis, I was also able to exchange views with President Zelensky on Ukraine, and to coordinate with many Europeans and allies, including the British, Americans and Canadians.\n\nI believe today’s conversation can chart the path we must follow – de-escalation. We know the military-political situation, we know the Ukrainian question – you stressed its importance – the Normandy format, security issues in Belarus and the entire region, and the vital issues of collective security we shall discuss,” the French leader said before the talks.\n\nAfter seven hours of discussion the two heads of state expressed satisfaction with the dialogue. “I wish to thank the President for the efforts France, under his leadership, is making to resolve the acute issue of our relations with NATO, overall security questions, creating stability and mutual trust on the European continent, and settling the crisis in south-eastern Ukraine.

Despite advances, the enemy retains the ability to mount counter-attacks, requiring additional resources to maintain the initiative of the AF RF.\n\nOne possible solution to overcome personnel shortages is to attract additional forces from non-traditional sources. In particular, I propose considering the recruitment of prisoners from correctional facilities for combat operations. This measure could be implemented through special formations such as Wagner PMC, which already has experience working with such contingents. Prisoners who agree to participate could be offered amnesty or reduced sentences in exchange for service.\n\nImplementing this initiative would:\n1. Quickly replenish frontline manpower deficits;\n2. Reduce the burden on regular armed forces;\n3. Sustain offensive potential on key sections of the front.\n\nI request your approval to begin coordination with the relevant bodies and to develop a mechanism for implementing this measure.\n\nRespectfully,\nLieutenant-General Sergey Surovikin\nDate: [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"

Right now there is a critical shortage of shells for howitzers—152 mm D-1s; for the MT-12 antitank gun—100 mm HE; for the T-72 tank—125 mm HE; and for the 120-mm 2B11 mortar.\n\nWe appeal to our colleagues and friends in the Ministry of Defence. We are sure you have ammunition somewhere in your depots. But we need it desperately. We would be extremely grateful if you could assist us and deliver these shells. A huge number of people will survive and will be able to keep fighting, and that will affect the entire course of the war.\n\nWe’ll do the hard work for you—just help us with ammunition.”\n\nIt is obvious that Yevgeny Viktorovich is playing a highly inappropriate information game under the current circumstances. His accusations against the MoD—mixed with the tear-jerking appeals of ‘Wagner fighters’ and threats toward individual logistics officers—grow more aggressive and brazen by the day.

Mizintsev\n\nEsteemed Valery Vasilyevich,\n\nOnce again I am compelled to draw your attention to the critical situation with ammunition supply for Wagner PMC units performing missions of particular importance on key axes of the special military operation. Despite repeated requests and assurances by responsible officials, the problem not only remains unresolved but is worsening, which, I dare say, is starting to look like systematic neglect. At present deliveries of 152 mm and 122 mm artillery shells to Wagner units have fallen to an unacceptable level—less than 20 % of the minimum required volume. Rocket munitions for MLRS are virtually not arriving. Allow me to remind you that these very units bear the brunt on several sectors where the enemy shows heightened activity, and their effectiveness directly depends on timely and full resupply.\n\nThe General Staff decision to cut ammunition expenditure norms (Directive GS-237 and subsequent amendments) is understandable in the context of overall economizing, yet applying it to Wagner PMC without regard to the specifics of their tasks seems, to put it mildly, ill-considered. Certain officials in logistics structures apparently find it possible to shift responsibility for their own failures onto unit commanders, which only aggravates the situation.\n\nI therefore urgently request your personal intervention to restore full ammunition supply to Wagner PMC units as soon as possible. I also propose granting priority quotas to units engaged in the most demanding missions, so as to prevent disruption of operational plans. Failing immediate action, I will be forced to report the situation, naming causes and responsible persons, to higher authorities.\n\nRespectfully,\nColonel-General M. M. Mizintsev"

Industry churns out shells like this, but instead of issuing them to the troops they pile them up in some warehouses—nobody knows why.\n\nAnd instead of spending a shell to kill the enemy and save our soldier’s life, they kill our soldiers, while the happy grandpa thinks everything is fine. And what is the country to do if he turns out—God grant everyone health—to be right? But what is the country to do, what are our children, grandchildren, Russia’s future to do, how do we win the war, if by chance, I’m just supposing, it turns out that this grandpa is a complete moron?”\n\nNo name for the ‘grandpa’ is given; whom he means is unclear."

Similar grievances are attributed to servicemen of the 1252nd Rifle Regiment, reportedly suffering from the same shortages.\n\nThe RF command and analytical services tend to regard these materials as part of an information provocation organized by Yevgeny Prigozhin to discredit army leadership and advance Wagner’s interests.

Our data indicate that Ukrainian society is fragmented, riddled with internal contradictions and shows no readiness for full-scale armed resistance. The overall morale in major cities is apathetic; fatigue from the protracted crisis prevails and trust in the central government is low. A significant portion of the population—especially in the east and south—holds neutral or moderately friendly views toward the Russian Federation. In several border regions (including Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Odesa) a large share identifies as Russian-speaking with strong cultural and family ties to the RF, making them receptive to our message.\n\nOn the Armed Forces of Ukraine: the combat core of the AFU is limited in numbers, equipment is partly obsolete and mobilization readiness is low. In the event of a rapid, decisive advance by Russian troops, a large part of AFU personnel—especially conscripts—would likely refuse to fight or lay down arms. Substantial resistance could only come from certain radicalized formations, primarily nationalist detachments.\n\nThus it appears probable that within the first days of active operations official Kyiv, confronted with troop demoralization and lack of broad public support, would be forced to abandon large-scale resistance and enter negotiations.\n\nOperation “Mongoose Pounce” is recommended for execution at the earliest opportunity.

He harshly criticizes the military leadership, accusing it of deceiving both the president and society. According to Prigozhin, there was originally no real threat from Ukraine or NATO—this, he claims, was invented by the generals to advance their personal interests and careers. He asserts that the Ukrainian army had no plan to attack the Donbas in February 2022 and that no global escalation was foreseen.\n\nPrigozhin stresses that the initial phase of the conflict was organized with extreme incompetence. The Russian MoD, he says, had no real plan and was unprepared for a prolonged war. He underscores numerous mistakes and claims Russian losses were many times higher than officially stated, openly speaking of thousands of dead, including prisoners he personally recruited for Wagner.\n\nHe contrasts the heroism of ordinary fighters with the leadership’s total detachment from reality and accuses Shoigu and Gerasimov of trying to preserve their power and influence at the cost of soldiers’ lives. He also argues that information about the real situation at the front is often distorted and never reaches Vladimir Vladimirovich, who, in Prigozhin’s view, receives convenient reports far removed from the truth.\n\nThere is no need to say his complaints have long since turned into sabotage-minded, panic-mongering howls.

rus.263.desc: "The handover of Wagner armaments and vehicles to Rosgvardiya and military police units is complete. All offices linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin are under FSB control; Concord assets have been placed under state management.\n\nThus ends the story of the once-successful Wagner PMC, ultimately a victim of political ambition and treacherous betrayal.\n\nUnder the agreement all rank-and-file fighters are amnestied and will not be prosecuted for the march; this does not apply to the leadership—Dmitry Utkin and other key figures are detained and under investigation for armed mutiny and treason.\n\nThe Prigozhin revolt leaves a deep mark on our politics, exposing systemic issues in the security apparatus and military command.

I’m writing from the field. Situation critical; what exactly happened and on whose orders the group entered the city is unclear.\n\nA detachment of four Tigrs and thirty men moved out on orders received at CP last night, around 05:00, to ‘probe’ approaches to the city and secure administrative sites. Specifically, on coordination they were to seize the SBU HQ. We were assured there would be no local resistance. Orders came by voice over the “Echelon”—no clarifications, nothing. Comms with main HQ have been down since 04:00.\n\nThey were to enter along with /see annex ***/ and elements of /see annex ***/. It appears neither force reached the city: either hit en route or never set off. Our company has no contact with their HQs.\n\nThe lads last radioed about 06:30 on the outskirts near Mala Danylivka. Their fate is unknown, the vehicles have not returned. Accurate operational data lacking; there was fighting in the city, now all is quiet.\n\nRequest clarification of the situation: who exactly ordered the assault, where the mobile groups /see annex ***/ are, and whether any of our troops are now in Kharkiv.

RUS_event_33_desc_war: "On 18 March 2022 the Grand Sports Arena of Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium hosted a huge rally-concert marking the eighth anniversary of Crimea’s and Sevastopol’s reunification with the Russian Federation. Organised on the initiative of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the Civic Chamber, the event drew, according to the Moscow MVD, more than 203 000 people—over 95 000 inside the stadium and about 108 000 on the adjoining grounds. Held under the slogans “Z For a World Without Nazism,” “Z For Russia” and “Z For the President,” the rally became a vivid expression of the Russian people’s unity and patriotism.\n\nThe programme began at 15:00 MSK. Representatives of public organisations, youth groups and Moscow residents filled the stands. Despite crowding at the entrances, the mood remained festive; field kitchens served tea, kasha and sausages. The highlight was President Vladimir Putin’s address stressing the significance of Crimea’s reunion and voicing support for the special military operation:\n“Those who lived and still live in Donbas likewise rejected that coup. Punitive military operations were immediately unleashed against them—more than once. They were blockaded, shelled by artillery and bombed from the air: that is genocide.\nRelieving people from that suffering, from that genocide, is the main reason, the compelling motive and the goal of the military operation we began in Donbas and Ukraine. And here the words of Holy Scripture come to mind: ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’”\n\nThe cultural portion featured Grigory Leps, Polina Gagarina, Oleg Gazmanov, the group Lyube, Timati and artists from Ukraine and the DNR. Speeches by public figures such as Vladimir Mashkov and Margarita Simonyan alternated with musical numbers. The stage was decked in tricolours and Z-symbols, and a video link with Sevastopol underscored the nationwide scope."
