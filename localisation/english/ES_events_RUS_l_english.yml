rus_holidays.1.desc: "Every year on February 23rd, Russia celebrates Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday dating back to 1918, when the first units of the Red Army were formed to protect the young Soviet Republic.

rus.1.desc: "Despite our obvious victories on the frontlines, the Ukrainian army is in no hurry to surrender. We have achieved most of our military and tactical goals, captured many settlements, and destroyed a huge amount of Ukrainian equipment and aircraft, but things are not going exactly according to our plan. Clearly, the special operation is dragging on, and our troop grouping is beginning to tire. It doesn't seem like Kyiv will be able to seize the initiative, but the General Staff has serious concerns about this."

Despite global difficulties, Russia managed to maintain stability and demonstrated the ability to adapt and develop.\n\nThe Russian economy gradually recovered after the pandemic downturn. Positive trends were observed in industry, agriculture, and exports. Rising energy prices strengthened the country’s position on the international stage. Social development continued in 2021: family support programs were expanded, new payments introduced, and aid for the underprivileged increased. Healthcare modernization was successful — advanced medical institutions were opened, digital services implemented, and medical staff qualifications improved.\n\nRussia strengthened cooperation with its strategic partners. Collaboration continued within the EAEU, SCO, CSTO, and BRICS frameworks. Agreements were signed with countries including China, India, and Iran in trade, energy, logistics, and defense sectors. International infrastructure projects linking East and West through Russia developed. Amid external pressure, these connections became especially important, ensuring economic and political resilience. Our partnership is built on pragmatism, mutual respect, and the pursuit of a multipolar world.\n\nRussia looks confidently to the future. Further development in all areas, breakthroughs in technology, and an unwavering place among the world’s leading powers await.\n'May love be in every heart and inspire us all to achieve set goals and conquer the highest peaks. For our loved ones and our one, great Motherland.'"

rus.5.t: "Widespread Support for Patriotic Bloggers"
rus.5.desc: "'Khokhols, you do understand that you will be destroyed?! We’ll come with tanks and raise this flag. I will personally bring this flag to Kyiv, hang it over the Verkhovna Rada building, and shout – «Kyiv is ours, b***h, you all, all suck it!» You'll come out with bread, with salt, with towels – ours, Ukrainian-Russian. You will come to greet us. We will shout «Yesss, come here, khokhols, suck it now you're all Russian! All of you come here, we’ll take all your territory, every last bit! And Lviv will be ours, and Donbas you’ll give us especially!»'\n- Vladislav Zhmilevsky\n\nIn the context of a prolonged information war with the West, independent media and patriotic bloggers delivering an “alternative perspective” to a wide audience are gaining special importance. Many of them voluntarily work for the good of the country, risking bans, sanctions, and pressure from foreign platforms. Figures like Yuri Podolyaka, Semyon Pegov (WarGonzo), Stas 'Ai Kak Prosto' and others form the core of a stable 'digital militia'.\n\nSome have already faced account suspensions, demonetization, and pressure from Western platforms. Yet their impact on the information agenda often surpasses that of official media. There are growing proposals to allocate resources for their support: grants, studios, Telegram promotion, and legal protection against foreign interference. However, skeptics argue that the state should not intervene in the “blogger sphere” or spend resources on it."

rus.5.b: "We will certainly expand support"


rus.8.t: "The Issue of the Russian-Ukrainian Crisis"
rus.8.desc: "But not everything is as smooth as we would like. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict, rooted in 2013, remains one of the region’s most acute problems.\n\nThe crisis began with mass protests in Ukraine in 2013, triggered by the then-government’s decision to abandon signing the Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deepening economic ties with Russia. These events, known as Euromaidan, quickly escalated into a political crisis and led to the overthrow of the legally elected president Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014.\n\nThe new Kyiv regime, formed with active participation of radical nationalist forces, pursued rapprochement with the West and attempted to forcibly regain control over eastern regions—particularly Donbas, where a significant portion of the population opposed the new authorities and restrictions on Russian speakers’ rights. Subsequently, residents of two oblasts proclaimed the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics—regions predominantly inhabited by Russians, seeking protection of their rights, culture, and historic ties with Russia. In March 2014, amid unrest and threats from the new Ukrainian authorities, a popular referendum was held in Crimea. Following it, the peninsula returned to the Russian Federation, provoking sharp reactions from Kyiv and Western countries, who viewed it as a violation of international law and annexation. At the same time, the conflict in Donbas was escalating. Active hostilities between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militias of the DPR and LPR continued from 2014 to 2015, after which a ceasefire was reached under the Minsk agreements. These accords provided for a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, prisoner exchanges, and political reforms in Ukraine, granting Donbas special status and organizing local elections under international observers.\n\nHowever, Kyiv repeatedly violated its commitments, leading to failures in the peace process and renewed localized clashes that continued until 2022. The inability of the Ukrainian authorities to fulfill Minsk conditions has long undermined our trust and calls for seeking alternative ways to resolve the conflict."

Though we did not expect such resistance from the Nazis, which left the city quite battered, we have achieved our goal! Now, our priority is to restore stability and order in the city, and to identify active collaborators of the neo-Nazi regime.

Punitive military operations were immediately launched against them — not just one. They were blockaded, systematically shelled with artillery, and hit by airstrikes — all this is what is called genocide.\nThe main, core reason, the motive and goal of the military operation we began in Donbas and Ukraine is precisely to relieve people of this suffering, this genocide. And here, you know, words from the Holy Scripture come to mind: there is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.'\n\nThe cultural program included performances by Grigory Leps, Polina Gagarina, Oleg Gazmanov, the band 'Lyube', Timati, and artists from Ukraine and the DPR.

My conscience and duty to the fighters who daily sacrifice their lives for Russia do not allow me to remain silent when I witness blatant injustice, betrayal, and criminal negligence that undermine the successful outcome of the Special Military Operation and the future of our state.\n\nFor many months, my fighters and I have faced systematic sabotage by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, particularly by Defense Minister Sergey Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov.\n\nUnder their leadership, the Ministry of Defense has systematically sabotaged the supply of ammunition to PMC Wagner, forcing our fighters to storm enemy positions without proper artillery support, even as warehouses overflow with shells. Their incompetent leadership not only slows down our progress but results in the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and volunteers — a level of negligence that borders on treason. Russian men, the best sons of the Fatherland, are dying not so much due to enemy actions, but due to a lack of resources, poor coordination, and senseless orders — a situation that can be rightly described as genocide against the Russian people. Additionally, rampant corruption, lack of discipline, cronyism, and the thirst for personal gain — all tolerated by the aforementioned individuals — are morally decaying the army and leading it toward self-destruction.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, I appeal to you as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, as the democratically elected President of Russia: investigate this situation. Review the actions of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. Find out why your direct orders are not being fulfilled and are being sabotaged. Remove Shoigu and Gerasimov from army leadership. Let us fight for Russia the way we know how — with full dedication and without interference from rear-line intrigue.\n\nI believe in your resolve and in your unwillingness to let the personal interests of a few individuals endanger the interests of the state. For Russia, for our fighters, for victory — take action.\nWith respect and hope for justice,\nYevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin"

The President gave the following comment:\n\n'You know, Yevgeny Viktorovich is an energetic, patriotic man, and I have known him for a long time. He has done a lot for our country, and his contributions, including those related to the Special Military Operation, are undoubtedly significant. We appreciate this. But as for his letter... I studied it carefully and must say that the accusations made there do not have sufficient grounds. Sergey Kuzhugetovich and Valery Vasilyevich are professionals who have to work in extremely difficult conditions. They do everything possible to provide our troops with everything necessary, and I trust their decisions.\n\nRegarding the shell shortage that Yevgeny Viktorovich talks about so much — this is a complex issue related to objective limitations. We are working on it, and no one is deliberately trying to weaken anyone. After all, our goal is one. I am sure misunderstandings can be resolved in a working manner without unnecessary emotions. Yevgeny Viktorovich is a straightforward man and sometimes speaks sharply, but I believe he does so only out of extreme love for the Motherland. The main thing is to continue working together for victory.'"

rus.75.t: "Choosing a New Defense Minister"
rus.75.d: "Following Sergey Shoigu’s resignation, the country's leadership faces the question of appointing a new Defense Minister. The previous leadership proved highly ineffective, emphasizing the need for a personnel reshuffle and reforms. When choosing a new minister, existing shortcomings and current needs of the armed forces must be considered. At present, there are three main candidate pools for this key position.\n\nSecurity forces (Veterans of FSB, Special Operations Forces):\nAppointing a representative of security agencies will strengthen coordination between the army and intelligence services. Their experience in intelligence and counterterrorism operations will provide high operational efficiency and centralization of the Ministry of Defense structures.

It produces what the country needs. More than that, with surplus.\n\nI know the warehouses, batch numbers, crate numbers. I clearly understand where what is located. And I know these ammunition supplies exist. But I cannot solve this problem despite all my acquaintances and connections. Everything is sinking and stuck. No decisions are being made. Generals, officers in military headquarters, in various positions help as much as they can. They try. They resist. Sometimes they break military laws to issue us the extra ammo we desperately need.\n\nOfficials point fingers upward, saying — you know, Yevgeny Viktorovich, you have difficult relations over there. Continuing to point upward and roll their eyes. So you need to apologize and repent. Then your fighters will get ammo. Apologize to whom? Repent to whom? 140 million Russians — please, tell me, to whom must I apologize so my guys die half as often as they do now?!\n\nI don’t accuse anyone and don’t want to lay blame. I just say — drop your whims. Drop your principles. And give us ammo.

The unit's commander, former convict Aleksei Marushchenko, known by the callsign 'Doctor', did not deny his guilt upon arrest. Moreover, he immediately expressed his willingness to cooperate with the investigation, stating that he was ready to testify against his fellow officers.\n\nThe case of PMC 'Yastreb' has only highlighted a broader issue: in many volunteer formations, commanders abuse their power and establish cruel practices bypassing regulations. The lack of proper oversight and clear mechanisms of accountability results in a collapse of discipline and constant brutality from the leadership. This poses serious risks both to rank-and-file fighters and to the combat effectiveness of such structures as a whole."

The military police are conducting mass arrests of these individuals and promptly transporting them to special temporary detention centers. At the front, a new neologism has appeared — 'Cargo 500', which denotes the 'refusers'. Despite their relatively small numbers, the actions of the 500s severely undermine organization and discipline within our troops. And the gaps they leave behind require fewer and fewer reserves. We need to immediately solve this problem before everything gets out of control."

rus.152.t: "The issue of blocking YouTube"
rus.152.desc: "Recently, the issue of blocking the popular video service YouTube has become a subject of discussions among both government officials and ordinary citizens. The platform is actively used by Ukrainian Nazis as a tool of informational warfare, considering their full support from Google employees. All our demands to moderate fake content remain unanswered. On the other hand, there are many pro-Russian users there. Also, blocking makes little sense due to widespread VPN use."

rus.154.desc: "In the 300th Anniversary Park of Saint Petersburg, in the Gulf of Finland area, flags of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the State Flag of the Russian Federation were raised to a height of 179.5 meters. This event marked the continuity of generations, symbolizing the inseparability of historical epochs and the significance of great traditions. Each of these flags was once the state symbol of Russia, under each of them victories, achievements, and feats were accomplished, but their trinity honors the centuries-old history. The raising of the flags is timed to significant dates related to the establishment of each: 165 years for the Russian Empire flag, 100 years for the Red Banner, and 330 years for the tricolor of Emperor Peter I."
rus.154.a: "The greatness of Russia has been preserved since ancient times"

rus.155.t: "Ideological Question"
rus.155.desc: "Lately, the question about our further political course has become sharper and sharper. Our state needs to determine the main ideological direction of our politics and propaganda. However, there is a problem — it is impossible to please everyone at once. If we start talking about the greatness of the Soviet past, there is a risk of losing the loyalty of various nationalists and 'turbo-patriots'. But swinging in the opposite direction is also dangerous — the leftists won't understand. And the idea of 'common Russian patriotism' can either alienate everyone from us or, on the contrary, become what unites the Russian people in these troubled times. Of course, we could just leave everything as it is, but how long will our regime last without a clear ideological orientation?..."

rus.156.desc: "From the very beginning of the Special Military Operation, the world has been flooded with footage of orderly columns of Russian armored vehicles marked with Z and V, crossing Ukraine's border checkpoints without any resistance. Hour after hour, commanders of the armored columns reported the capture of new settlements, moving deeper into enemy territory. It seemed that armored columns would take major Ukrainian cities without a single shot within just a few days. But in the end, it all turned out to be an illusion. Facing resistance from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our equipment got stuck in traffic jams and was destroyed one by one, unable to retreat in an organized manner. One of the main tactics of the special operation in Ukraine, chosen by the General Staff, completely failed."
rus.156.a: "Damn!"

rus.157.t: "Ultimatum to the Government of Ukraine"
rus.157.desc: "During the largest military operation in Europe since World War II, the Russian army, facing no resistance, crossed the border into Ukraine, defeated the small territorial defense detachments, and subsequently liberated several settlements, including large cities. All objectives of Operation 'Mongoose Leap' were achieved. The Nazi regime of Zelensky is no longer able to hold the front and will inevitably fall soon. From this position, we send an ultimatum to the government of Ukraine demanding capitulation. We hope for their voluntary surrender and compliance with our demands, but in case of refusal, we will finish what was started and crush the Banderite scum."

rus.158.t: "The Special Military Operation Went Off Plan"
rus.158.desc: "No matter how successful the advance in Ukraine was in the first days of the Special Military Operation, after a month all the shortcomings of army command and organization in our ranks became apparent. After a month of fighting, our soldiers failed to achieve all the set objectives, which effectively means the failure of Operation 'Mongoose Leap' and the disruption of the General Staff plans of the RF Armed Forces. Now the only correct decisions left are a total revision of our military doctrine, large-scale personnel reshuffles, and preparation for a long, protracted war..."

rus.182.t: "Formation of a New Ukrainian Government"
rus.182.desc: "It is necessary to decide on the composition of the interim government of Ukraine. Among the proposed options for acting president, four main candidates can be highlighted:\n\nV. V. Medvedchuk — a Ukrainian statesman, public, and political figure. One of the founders of the pro-Russian party OPFL. A figure close to Putin and the Russian authorities. Currently head of the temporary military-civilian administration of Kyiv. The most acceptable option.\n\nY. A. Boyko — Ukrainian statesman and political figure. Member of OPFL and Medvedchuk’s right hand. In 2014, during negotiations with Ukraine, he was nominated by us to head Luhansk Oblast. Pursues a more moderate domestic policy, taking into account the interests of both Russia and the Ukrainian people.\n\nV. F. Yanukovych — former president of Ukraine, unlawfully overthrown in the 2014 coup and fled to Russia. Carried out a balanced policy with a clear pro-Russian tilt. He is the most legitimate candidate, but extremely unpopular among the Ukrainian people.\n\nI. V. Kiva — former member of parliament from OPFL, member of the committee on legislative support of law enforcement. On the eve of the Special Operation, he left for Russia via Spain. Has a questionable past related to the 'Right Sector' and participation in combat operations in eastern Ukraine as part of the 'Poltava' battalion. Holds a radical stance toward the former Ukrainian junta. Repeatedly voiced support for President Putin’s policies and the 'merging' of Ukraine and Russia."

rus.183.t: "Unification of Novorossiya"
rus.183.desc: "Talks about the creation of Novorossiya began at the very start of the conflict, almost immediately after the formation of the DPR and LPR. The confederation project 'Union of People's Republics — Novorossiya' was adopted on May 24, 2014, resulting in the formation of the UNR Council, which included three representatives from each side. On June 24–25, the Supreme Councils of the DPR and LPR delegated 30 deputies each to the future UNR parliament, and DPR Prime Minister Alexander Borodai stated that the union state would have its own constitution. However, the Second Minsk Agreements did not provide for the realization of Novorossiya, which led to the project being frozen.\n\nNow, after the fall of the Kyiv regime, the possibility of implementing the confederation is once again being actively discussed. The heads of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics propose reviving the project by including all historical Novorossiya territories liberated during the Special Operation. An equally popular proposal is to incorporate these territories into the Russian Federation as new subjects. One thing is clear — the future of eastern Ukraine lies only with Russia."

The initial plan did not envision the full occupation of Ukrainian territory, but as the Special Operation progressed, it became clear that this was the only correct decision. Now we must deal with the consequences of years of Banderite and Western puppet rule over our once brotherly people."

NATO states that such actions undermine stability in Europe and increase tension on the alliance’s eastern flank.\n\nWestern countries perceive Russia’s maneuvers as a threat to the security of Ukraine and NATO allies. In response to Russia’s actions, the alliance calls for an immediate reduction in military presence and a withdrawal from Ukraine’s borders, warning of consequences in case of further escalation. At the same time, the note emphasizes that the doors for dialogue remain open, if Russia is willing to discuss de-escalation."

This limits combat capabilities, reduces fire support intensity, and forces conservation of ammo even in situations where it shouldn't be done. If deliveries are not increased soon, the risk of mission failure will grow significantly. To stabilize the situation and ensure uninterrupted supply, it is necessary to urgently reactivate and deploy existing stockpiles of shells."

There are enough shells for current tasks as well as for potential high-intensity battles in the future. Under these circumstances, part of the ammunition can be redirected to storage, creating a strategic reserve that may come in handy later.

The number of patriots eager to join the fight against the genocide of the Russian people is truly impressive. However, we are increasingly noticing dubious individuals among them, openly supporting far-right and neo-Nazi ideologies. This is nothing new. Such activists have been fighting on the side of the People's Republics since 2014, though it was never widely publicized or condemned.\n\nWhat makes the situation more controversial are the questionable ties between RIM and foreign far-right organizations — particularly with §RAtomwaffen Division§!. AWD militants have undergone combat training at Imperial Legion facilities since 2015, and in 2020, a Russian cell — §RAtomwaffen Russland§! — was formed under RIM's wing. Equally troubling are the links to the Order of Nine Angles, a satanic and neopagan international terrorist network, whose followers are reportedly forming a unit called §RAAST§! within the Imperial Legion.\n\nAll of this stands in stark contrast to our official rhetoric about 'fighting Ukrainian neo-Nazism'. Still, as long as we can keep the radicals under control, there's no need to worry... Right?"

rus.200.t: "National Bolsheviks Support the Special Operation"
rus.200.desc: "The National Bolshevik Party 'The Other Russia', founded by Eduard Limonov, has historically taken extremely radical positions toward Ukraine. Back in 1992, Limonov openly stated: a conflict between Russians and Ukrainians would begin over Crimea. The demand to return Russia's historical territories — including Crimea, Donbas, and Kharkiv — became a key part of the party's program long before the events of 2014. It’s no surprise that with the start of the 'Russian Spring', the National Bolsheviks played a notable role in these processes.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, amid the Crimean events, 'The Other Russia' announced the creation of the 'Society of Crimean Tourism Enthusiasts'. On the party’s website, a volunteer form appeared, including the question 'Military Specialty'. Soon, anti-Kyiv sentiment spread across Novorossiya. Donbas and Kharkiv became especially active points, where party activists headed from Crimea. Among them stood out the Latvian National Bolshevik Benes Ayo, nicknamed the 'Black Lenin' for his fiery speeches at Donetsk rallies, and journalist from Yekaterinburg Rostislav Zhuravlyov, who took part in the storming of government buildings in both Kharkiv and Donetsk. In April 2014, 'The Other Russia' organized a special 'Ukrainian Congress', and on May 6 — just days after the tragic events in Odesa — the party announced the formation of the volunteer movement 'Interbrigades'. Its members actively joined the defense of the people's republics of Donbas from the Ukrainian junta that had seized power in Kyiv.\n\nWhen our President announced the beginning of the Special Military Operation to protect the people of Donbas, the National Bolsheviks embraced it with great enthusiasm. 'The Other Russia' is actively preparing many volunteers for deployment to Ukraine and is also collecting humanitarian aid for the residents of the People's Republics. Some party activists have also proposed reorganizing the 'Interbrigades' as an official volunteer formation under the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The corresponding proposal has already been submitted to the Ministry of Defense."

The issue of appealing to the President regarding the need to recognize the DPR and LPR was considered via a ranking vote, with the variant receiving the most votes being chosen. Competing resolutions came from the Communist Party (CPRF) and United Russia: the latter proposed consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while the former called for immediate appeal to the President.\n\nThe Communist Party’s proposal was supported by 351 deputies, with 16 voting against and 1 abstaining. United Russia’s project received 310 votes.\n\n'By a majority vote, resolution No. 58243-8 is adopted: "On the Appeal of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, on the Necessity of Recognizing the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic". The resolution will be signed immediately and sent to the Head of State. Colleagues, we have made our decision,' said State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.

The meeting is being chaired personally by Vladimir Vladimirovich. On the agenda is the final decision on the recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief begins by giving a general overview of the situation in Ukraine since 2014.\n\n'We are gathered here today to discuss the situation developing in Donbas.\n\nLet me briefly remind you of what has been happening there, how the situation has evolved — even though you all know it well — but for the sake of a complete picture to help us make the appropriate decisions. So, after the coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014, part of the population of that country rejected the change of power. Let me remind you, it was an unconstitutional and bloody coup, as many innocent people died during the events. It was indeed an armed overthrow — and no one really disputes this. As I said, part of the citizens rejected it. This included both those living in Crimea and those living — and still living — in Donbas.\n\nThese people declared the formation of two independent republics — the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. From that moment, confrontation between the Kyiv authorities and the people of these territories began. In this regard, I want to stress that Russia initially did everything possible to resolve all arising contradictions by peaceful means. Nevertheless, the Kyiv authorities carried out two military punitive operations in these territories, and it seems we are witnessing an escalation for the third time.'\n\nRepresentatives of various state structures will also express their opinions on how to resolve the Donbas crisis."

rus.203.desc: "S. Lavrov: Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich! Dear colleagues!\n\nAs previously reported, we have assessed the responses from the U.S. and NATO to our proposals on security guarantees. Western colleagues rejected the key initiatives, including NATO's non-expansion to the East, citing the policy of 'open doors' and freedom of choice. The principle of indivisible security that we rely on is being ignored, especially the clause stating that the security of one should not be strengthened at the expense of another.\n\nWe sent letters to Western partners analyzing the OSCE obligations and Russia–NATO agreements, including the 1997 Founding Act. We proposed returning NATO's force configuration on the eastern flank to its 1997 state, but this too was rejected. In response, we were urged to 'end the occupation of Crimea' and withdraw troops from Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. proposed to discuss limits on intermediate-range missiles, though they themselves exited the treaty with Russia. Issues of reducing military risks and increasing transparency were also mentioned, but detached from the broader context.\n\nOur impression: Western partners try to highlight secondary aspects, avoiding the discussion of key issues like NATO expansion and force configuration. They link dialogue to de-escalation around Ukraine.\n\nWe will continue working, insisting on the integrity of our proposals. We are ready to discuss the U.S. suggestions, but only in the context of answers to the main questions: halting NATO expansion and revising its military presence in Europe.\n\nFollowing your instructions, the documents were sent to Washington. Secretary Blinken expressed willingness to discuss them at the upcoming meeting in Geneva this week. We will act within the positions you have approved."

Dear colleagues!\n\nI will not go into details of the complicated Minsk negotiations, but it is obvious that neither Ukraine nor its Western allies want Donbass on any terms. Their goal is to freeze the conflict, shifting political and economic responsibility onto Russia, including support of Donbass.\n\nWe spend huge funds on humanitarian aid to these territories. At the same time, Donbass suffers from a labor shortage: the number of vacancies exceeds the number of unemployed by 2.5 times. This is the result of our measures, including issuing passports, which may contradict economic goals.\n\nUkraine and the West are not interested in conflict resolution. Any question about returning Donbass under Ukraine's control causes them to freeze. They just remain silent, not knowing how to respond.\n\nRegarding Donbass, probably there is no need to explain the political and economic reasons that...\n\nV.

Most residents of the contact zone have been evacuated, but some remain due to continuous-cycle enterprises. Today, a miner died from an artillery shell. Over the last night, there were more than 40 shellings, all targeted at predetermined locations.\n\nAt the borders of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, 59.3 thousand Ukrainian servicemen are concentrated, with 345 tanks, 2160 combat armored vehicles, 820 artillery and mortars, 160 multiple rocket launchers including ''Smerch'' systems. Heavy equipment, contrary to agreements, has been returned to positions. Nationalist battalions operate poorly managed by central command, leading to sabotage, terror attacks, and infrastructure destruction.\n\nParticular danger is posed by Zelensky's statement about Ukraine regaining nuclear status. Ukraine still retains technologies, equipment, and specialists to create nuclear weapons and their carriers like the ''Tochka-U''. This, combined with nationalist units' activity, creates an extremely tense situation.\n\nIn the past month, escalation has been observed: equipment is moving, radio frequencies change, shellings increase.

These are the 'red lines' the President has spoken about many times at various forums and meetings.\n\nWe face a difficult choice—whether to recognize the independence of the DPR and LPR. The experience of 2008 with recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia showed that such decisions save lives and serve as a lesson for NATO. Today, the situation is more complicated due to the scale of the potential conflict, but simpler because we know what to expect from the West: sanctions and pressure. However, experience shows that over time, tensions ease and partners return to dialogue themselves.\n\nAbout 800 thousand Russian citizens live in the DPR and LPR territories.

They already have so many weapons there that it would suffice for many kinds of large and small conflicts they stubbornly arrange in the territories of both the Luhansk and Donetsk republics.\n\nBut when every day there arrive four, five, and there were days with eight flights of modern weapons, and when they say this is defensive, I find it hard to imagine that the same 'Javelins' are defensive weapons. And there are already more of them there, Vladimir Vladimirovich, than in some NATO member countries.

Of course, my address is also to our compatriots in Ukraine. I will have to speak thoroughly and in detail. This is a very serious issue.\n\nThe situation in Donbass has again become critical and acute. Today I address you directly not only to assess what is happening but also to inform you about the decisions taken and possible further steps in this direction.\n\nSo, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, or rather by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his comrades did it quite crudely toward Russia itself—by separating and detaching part of its own historical territories. Of course, millions of people who lived there were never asked anything.\n\nI am not blaming anyone now; the situation in the country at that time and after the Civil War was incredibly difficult and critical. Today, I only want to say that it was exactly so. This is a historical fact. In fact, as I said, as a result of Bolshevik policy, the Soviet Ukraine arose, which to this day can with full grounds be called 'Ukraine named after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.' He is its author and architect. This is fully confirmed by archival documents, including Lenin's harsh directives regarding Donbass, which was literally forced into Ukraine. And now the 'grateful descendants' have demolished Lenin monuments in Ukraine. This is called decommunization there.\n\n§RYou want decommunization? Well, that suits us perfectly.

Since 1991, it has gone down the path of mechanical copying of foreign models, detached both from history and from Ukrainian realities. Political state institutions have been constantly reshaped to please quickly formed clans with their own selfish interests, having nothing in common with the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nA stable statehood has not been formed in Ukraine, and political, elective procedures serve only as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property among various oligarchic clans.\n\nCorruption, which without doubt is a challenge and problem for many countries, including Russia, in Ukraine has acquired a somewhat special character. It literally soaked and eroded the Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, all branches of power. Radicals took advantage of the just discontent of the people, rode the protest, and in 2014 brought the Maidan to a state coup. Radicals who seized power organized persecution, a real terror against those who opposed unconstitutional actions. It is impossible to recall without shuddering the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where participants of a peaceful protest were brutally killed, burned alive in the Trade Unions House.\n\nHow long can this tragedy continue? How much more can this be endured? Russia did everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity, all these years persistently and patiently fought for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which enshrined the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015 for resolving the situation in Donbass. All in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies change, but the essence does not change, the aggressive nationalist character of the very regime that seized power in Kyiv.\n\n§RIn this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision — to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic.§!'"

And we know the situation, the military-political situation, we know the Ukrainian issue—you reminded how important it is — the 'Normandy format', security issues in Belarus and the entire region, and important collective security issues, which we will discuss.' — said the French leader in a prelude to the talks.\n\nFollowing the 7-hour discussion, the heads of state were satisfied with the dialogue. 'I want to thank the president for the efforts France undertakes under his leadership regarding the resolution of the very acute issue related to our relations with NATO, generally on issues related to security, the creation on the European continent of a stable environment, mutual trust, and resolving the crisis in southeastern Ukraine.

Where does the disdainful, neglectful attitude towards our interests and absolutely legitimate demands come from?\n\nDespite everything, in December 2021 we still made yet another attempt to negotiate with the United States and their allies on principles of security in Europe and on NATO non-expansion. All in vain.\n\nIn this regard — and about the situation in Donbass. We see that the forces that in 2014 carried out a coup in Ukraine, seized power, and hold it with the help, essentially, of decorative electoral procedures, have finally abandoned peaceful settlement of the conflict.

According to received data, the organization has begun preparing sabotage actions aimed at disrupting the rear supply of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (RF Armed Forces). Particular attention is paid to the railway infrastructure in the Republic of Belarus, through which the supply of the Russian forces heading toward Kyiv is carried out. Coordination of COAC actions with representatives of the Belarusian opposition is noted, and it is highly likely that the organization is overseen by Ukrainian special services.\n\nAt the time of this report, no specific sabotage acts have yet been recorded.

According to the terms, they received pardons and were released from further serving their sentences. Hundreds of former convicts, many of whom have extensive criminal experience, are now returning to civilian life. Their release went without much publicity but already causes concern among local authorities and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe situation is similar to the recent demobilization of Wagner PMC fighters, which led to a surge in crime in several regions. Experts predict that a significant portion of former 'Storm-Z' fighters, accustomed to violence and maintaining connections with the criminal world, may return to illegal activities. Street robberies, racketeering, and drug trafficking are only part of the threats that may increase due to the influx of these people. The issue of controlling their further fate remains open, increasing societal tension."

According to the agreements, they received official pardons and are now free, also having the option to renew their contracts if desired.\n\nHundreds of ex-prisoners return to the regions, bringing with them combat skills honed in war and maintained ties with the criminal environment. Analysts predict an increase in crime levels: from petty offenses like street robberies to more organized activities such as drug trafficking and racketeering.\n\nThe issue of adapting former Wagner fighters remains unresolved.

Despite advances, the enemy retains the ability to counterattack, requiring additional resources to maintain the initiative of the RF Armed Forces.\n\nOne possible solution to the personnel shortage is to involve additional forces from non-traditional sources. In particular, I propose considering the recruitment of convicts from correctional institutions for participation in combat operations. This measure can be implemented through the involvement of special units such as the Wagner PMC, which already have experience working with such contingents. Convicts agreeing to participate may be offered amnesty or sentence reduction in exchange for service.\n\nImplementation of this initiative will allow:\n1. Rapid replenishment of personnel shortage at the front.\n2. Reduction of the load on regular armed forces.\n3.

Despite repeated appeals and assurances from responsible persons, the problem is not only unresolved but worsening, which, I dare say, is beginning to take on the character of systematic neglect. At present, deliveries of 152 mm and 122 mm artillery shells to Wagner PMC units have been reduced to an unacceptable level, amounting to less than 20% of the minimally required volume. Rocket ammunition for multiple launch rocket systems is practically not being supplied. Allow me to remind you that these units bear the main burden on several sections where the enemy demonstrates increased activity, and their effectiveness directly depends on timely and full supply.\n\nThe General Staff's decision to reduce ammunition consumption rates (Resolution GS-237 and subsequent amendments) is understandable in the context of overall conservation, however, its application to Wagner PMC without regard to the specifics of their tasks seems, to put it mildly, not fully thought out. Some officials in the logistics structures apparently consider it possible to shift responsibility for their failures onto the commanders of the units, which only exacerbates the situation.\n\nIn this regard, I urgently request your personal intervention to restore full ammunition supply to Wagner PMC units as soon as possible. I also propose to consider allocating priority quotas for deliveries to units performing tasks of increased complexity to avoid disruption of operational plans. In the absence of immediate measures, I will be forced to report the situation to higher authorities with an indication of causes and responsible persons.\n\nRespectfully,\nColonel General M.M.

Industry is producing these shells, but instead of delivering them to the troops, they are stockpiled in certain warehouses, for reasons unknown.\n\nAnd instead of spending the shell, killing the enemy, saving the life of our soldier, our soldiers are dying, and the happy happy old geezer thinks that he is fine. And what will happen next to the country if he turns out to be right, God bless everyone, but what will happen to the country, what will happen to our children, grandchildren, the future of Russia, and how to win the war, if suddenly, I just suppose, it turns out that this old man is a complete asshole?'\n\nThe name of the 'geezer' does not appear in the comment.

Similar complaints are attributed to soldiers of the 1252nd Rifle Regiment, who, according to these reports, are also suffering from shortages of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThe Russian Army command and intelligence services believe that these materials are part of an information operation orchestrated by Yevgeny Prigozhin to discredit the military leadership and promote the interests of the Wagner PMC.

rus.264.desc: "Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich,\nI hereby report on the analysis of the socio-political situation in Ukraine and the assessment of the combat readiness of its armed forces. According to our data, Ukrainian society is largely fragmented, rife with internal contradictions, and does not demonstrate readiness for full-scale armed resistance. The overall moral and psychological state in major cities is one of apathy, marked by fatigue from the prolonged crisis and low trust in the central government. A significant portion of the population, especially in the eastern and southern regions, holds a neutral or moderately loyal stance toward the Russian Federation. In several border regions (including Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Odesa), a considerable share of the population identifies as Russian-speaking, with strong cultural and familial ties to Russia, making them receptive to our message.\n\nAs for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the following has been established: the combat core of the AFU is limited in number, its equipment is partly outdated, and its mobilization readiness is low. In the event of a swift and decisive advance by Russian forces, a large share of AFU personnel — especially conscripts — will likely refuse to engage in combat or surrender their weapons. Armed resistance may be offered only by certain radicalized formations, primarily nationalist paramilitary units.\n\nBased on this, it seems likely that within the first days of active operations, official Kyiv — faced with demoralized troops and lack of public support — will be forced to abandon large-scale resistance and move toward negotiations.\n\nOperation 'Mongoose Strike' is recommended for immediate execution. The corresponding rationale has been delivered to the Ministry of Defense.\n\nPrepared by: Fifth Service of the FSB of the Russian Federation\nDate: [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\n\nSigned:\nFirst Deputy Director of the FSB of the Russian Federation\nArmy General Korolyov Sergey Borisovich"

He harshly criticizes the military leadership, accusing it of deceiving both the president and the public. According to Prigozhin, there was never any real threat from Ukraine or NATO — it was, in his words, fabricated by generals to pursue personal gain and career advancement. He claims that the Ukrainian army had no plans to attack Donbas in February 2022, and no large-scale escalation was expected at the time.\n\nPrigozhin highlights the extremely unprofessional organization of the initial phase of the conflict. The Russian Ministry of Defense, he argues, had no real plan and was unprepared for a protracted war. He emphasizes that military operations were marked by numerous mistakes, and that actual Russian casualties were far higher than officially stated. Prigozhin speaks openly of thousands of dead soldiers, including convicts he personally recruited to fight with Wagner PMC.\n\nHe contrasts the heroism of ordinary soldiers with the complete detachment of leadership from reality and accuses Shoigu and Gerasimov of clinging to power and influence at the expense of soldiers' lives. He also stresses that information about the true situation on the battlefield is often distorted and never reaches Vladimir Vladimirovich, who, according to Prigozhin, receives only convenient reports far from the truth.\n\nNeedless to say, his complaints have long crossed the line into sabotage and hysterical demagoguery.

A curfew was imposed in the city from 20:00, with reinforced patrols of the Interior Ministry and National Guard.

rus.100.a: "Prigozhin, by the way, is an oligarch himself"
rus.100.d: "The head of the PMC “Wagner,” Yevgeny Prigozhin, gave a major interview in which he spoke about the origins of the war and the first days of the Russian Armed Forces’ advance into Ukraine. In the video, the head of the “Musicians” once again poured dirt on our authorities and our valiant army, claiming that the Special Military Operation in Ukraine was allegedly not intended to liberate the residents of Donbas, but to serve the “interests of oligarchs.” Naturally, most of the so-called “facts” were taken out of thin air or stripped of context. Prigozhin allows himself more and more disgusting statements. It is time to rein him in."

rus.101.a: "What are his true goals?"
rus.101.d: "We have received the latest scandalous reports amid the withdrawal of PMC “Wagner” fighters from the SMO zone. The mercenaries report that the evacuation routes prepared for them were mined. In addition, several hours later we received another report about the capture of our lieutenant colonel, who allegedly opened fire on a vehicle belonging to the “Musicians.” Military police and investigators, as well as FSB Internal Security officers, have been dispatched to the area. Although an official investigation has not yet begun, it is obvious that this entire situation is merely a provocation aimed at inciting public outrage and dissatisfaction. It is unclear what Zhenya hopes to achieve by this, but one thing is clear — he is planning something bad."

rus.102.a: "When will he finally shut up?"
rus.102.d: "Yevgeny Prigozhin has given another interview, this time to Konstantin Dolgov, a journalist for the stream show “Telega Online.” In the video, the head of Wagner harshly criticized our government, Shoigu, Gerasimov, the “failure” of the SMO, “huge losses,” unsuccessful airborne operations, the quality of our equipment, and more. A preventive conversation with Yevgeny Viktorovich is required to explain that such statements are unacceptable in the current situation."

The Ukrainian government agreed to our demands. Russia has returned its historical lands to their native harbor and protected the residents of Donbas from neo-Nazis who intimidated ordinary people. The West has lost enormous sums on supplying Ukraine with weapons and equipment and is now drowning in debt. Glory to Russia! Glory to the nation!"

It is being broadcast on television and distributed via various messengers, thereby spreading the truth to citizens. We will stop the traitor who traded his homeland for ambition."
