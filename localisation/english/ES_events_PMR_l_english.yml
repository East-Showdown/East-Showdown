pdr.1.t: "Transnistria’s Situation in 2022"
pdr.1.desc: "The Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) is an unrecognised, land-locked state wedged between Ukraine and Moldova. It emerged after seceding from the Moldavian SSR in 1990 and prevailing in the 1992 conflict. That year Moldovan troops, joined by Romanian volunteers, attacked us; few believed we could hold, yet the 14th—still Soviet—Army in Tiraspol barred their advance, and volunteers from Russia and Ukraine helped fix today’s borders. Moscow’s intervention then froze the war.\n\nBy 2022 we are managing, but we remain heavily dependent on Russia for both economics and politics—protection is the price. Our independence is recognised only by fellow unrecognised states: Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Artsakh. With a PMR passport one can travel almost nowhere, so most citizens keep second passports from Moldova, Ukraine, Russia or even Romania.\n\nOur leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, graduated with honours from the Kharkiv military academy but refused to swear allegiance to independent Ukraine and fled to our republic. Much work lies ahead to raise living standards, and we can only hope that \"big brother\" Russia will help us."
pdr.1.a: "Let’s hope for the best"

pdr.2.t: "Our Choice"
pdr.2.desc: "Rumours of imminent war between Russia and Ukraine fill the information space. Such a conflict would directly affect us, for an invasion of our land is possible. The PMR Supreme Council believes the wisest course is to stay out, since Ukraine has little reason to attack; yet many citizens favour fighting Ukraine alongside Russia, seeing a chance for the PMR finally to enter the Russian Federation. The decision is yours: shall we gear up for war or preserve neutrality?"
pdr.2.a: "A choice must be made"

pdr.3.t: "Has the Time Come?"
pdr.3.desc: "The country is stable for now, but continued isolation could soon leave us unable to resist an external invasion. We must decide what course to take."
pdr.3.a: "We must enter the war on Russia’s side!"
pdr.3.b: "One war in the 1990s was enough"

pdr.4.t: "Ukrainian Unrest"
pdr.4.desc: "Many Ukrainians live in our country. Because of our war with Ukraine they have begun to protest."
pdr.4.a: "Unpleasant"
