VLADIMIR_PUTIN_DESCRIPTION: "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). His father, Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, fought in the Great Patriotic War, while his mother, Maria Ivanovna, was a factory worker. The family lived in a communal apartment, and the future president’s childhood unfolded amid post-war poverty. At school Putin was an average student but showed keen interest in sports—especially judo—eventually earning the rank of Master of Sport.\n\nIn 1975 he graduated from the Law Faculty of Leningrad State University and joined the KGB. From 1985 to 1990 he served in the GDR as an intelligence officer. Leaving the service with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he began a civilian career.\n\nIn the early 1990s he worked in the Saint Petersburg mayor’s office; in 1996 he moved to Moscow, rapidly climbing the administrative ladder. In 1998 he became director of the FSB, and in August 1999—prime minister. After Boris Yeltsin’s unexpected resignation on 31 December 1999, Putin became acting president and soon won the election.\n\nHe served as president from 2000 to 2008, then as prime minister under Medvedev, and returned to the presidency in 2012 and 2018. His tenure has seen strengthened centralization of power, the Second Chechen War, the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and heightened tensions with the West. By 2022 he remained the dominant political figure in Russia."

PENIS_DYSHILIN_DESCRIPTION: "Banned swapping letters in words...\n\nDenis Vladimirovich Pushilin was born on 9 May 1981 in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR. In the early 2000s he worked in various commercial ventures, including the notorious MMM pyramid scheme. Until 2014 he had no political fame.\n\nIn spring 2014, amid protests and armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, Pushilin emerged as a public representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). He actively organized the ‘referendum’ on independence and soon became chairman of the DPR Supreme Council. Though lacking charisma, he proved a manageable and loyal politician acceptable to Moscow’s curators.\n\nAfter the 2018 assassination of Aleksandr Zakharchenko, Pushilin became acting head of the DPR and later ‘won’ the election to hold the post officially. Under his leadership Russian influence deepened, and the republic integrated further into Russia’s legal and administrative systems as he consistently voiced pro-Russian positions.\n\nBy 2022 Denis Pushilin remained head of the DPR, effectively serving as the Kremlin-aligned administrator of the territory."

LEONID_PASECHNIK_DESCRIPTION: "Leonid Ivanovich Pasechnik was born on 15 March 1970 in Voroshilovgrad (now Luhansk), Ukrainian SSR. He graduated from a higher military-political school and earned qualifications in security. From the early 1990s he served in Ukraine’s state-security bodies, rising to colonel. He gained recognition for intercepting a major smuggling operation.\n\nWhen war broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Pasechnik sided with the newly declared Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). He became its minister of state security and helped build its security apparatus. In November 2017, after Igor Plotnitsky was ousted, Pasechnik became acting head of the LPR and soon assumed the post officially.\n\nHe cast himself as a pro-integration hard-liner toward Russia and Ukraine alike. Under his rule internal political control tightened and legislation, education, and defense drew closer to Russian standards.\n\nBy 2022 Leonid Pasechnik remained a key figure among the Donbas republics—an obedient yet loyal administrator within Russia’s sphere of influence."

JENS_STOLTENBERG_DESCRIPTION: "Jens Stoltenberg was born on 16 March 1959 in Oslo, Norway, to prominent politician and diplomat Thorvald Stoltenberg. He earned an economics degree at the University of Oslo and embarked on a political career in the Norwegian Labour Party. In his youth he took part in anti-war movements but later became a proponent of Euro-Atlantic integration.\n\nDuring the 1990s he held key ministerial posts, including industry and finance. He first became prime minister in 2000, though briefly. From 2005 to 2013 he again headed the government, enacting social and economic reforms and earning a reputation as a pragmatic, steady leader.\n\nIn 2014, amid the Ukraine crisis and worsening relations with Russia, Stoltenberg was appointed NATO Secretary-General. He adopted a firm stance on strengthening Alliance defense, modernizing member forces, and deterring external threats. Under his tenure NATO increased its presence in Eastern Europe and broadened cooperation with partners in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nBy 2022 Jens Stoltenberg remained a key architect of Euro-Atlantic security, mixing diplomatic restraint with robust military support for NATO members—especially during mounting confrontation with Russia and the invasion of Ukraine."


ALEX_LYKOSHENKO_DESCRIPTION: "Alyaksandr Ryhoravich Lukashenko was born on 30 August 1954 in the village of Kopys, Vitebsk Oblast, Byelorussian SSR. Raised by his mother in a rural household, he worked on collective farms and later graduated from the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute and the Belarusian Agricultural Academy. Before entering politics he served in the Soviet Army and held managerial posts in kolkhozes.\n\nIn the early 1990s he became a deputy of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, quickly gaining a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader. Riding a wave of public discontent, he won the first presidential election of independent Belarus in 1994 with a populist, anti-corruption platform and, within his first term, began constructing a highly centralized system of power.\n\nLukashenko pursued close integration with Russia while preserving a measure of autonomy. His rule featured the rollback of democratic institutions, suppression of the opposition, tight control over the media, and repeated accusations of electoral fraud. He has been re-elected multiple times amid mass protests and international criticism.\n\nAfter the contested 2020 presidential election—marked by unprecedented demonstrations and the West’s refusal to recognize his legitimacy—Lukashenko found himself internationally isolated and increasingly dependent on Kremlin support."

VADIM_KOLESNIKOV_DESCRIPTION: "Vadim Nikolayevich Krasnoselsky was born on 14 April 1970 in Zabaykalye (now Russia). In 1987 his family moved to Bendery, Transnistria, where he finished school and, in 1993, graduated with honors from the Kharkiv Higher Military Command and Engineering School of Missile Forces. In 2000 he earned a law degree from the T. Shevchenko Transnistrian State University.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2012 he served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the PMR, rising from inspector to Minister of Internal Affairs (2007–2012). In 2008 he was promoted to militia major general. After a change of power he worked in the security service of the Sheriff company and, in December 2015, was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council of the PMR.\n\nOn 11 December 2016 Krasnoselsky won the presidential election with 62 percent of the vote, taking office on 16 December. He was re-elected for a second term in December 2021. Under his leadership Transnistria strengthened ties with Russia: opening a representative office in Moscow, filing a lawsuit against Moldova, and expanding the Russian military presence. In 2017, with Russian support, the Suvorov Military School was established in Tiraspol. Krasnoselsky advocates removing Soviet symbols and restoring pre-revolutionary names, including dismantling Lenin monuments, and has spoken favorably of a limited constitutional monarchy modeled on the Russian Empire."

EVGENIY_PRIGOSHIN_DESCRIPTION: "Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin was born on 1 June 1961 in Leningrad. In his youth he had problems with the law: in 1981 he was convicted of robbery and fraud and spent about nine years in prison. After his release in the 1990s he went into business—starting with hot-dog stalls and later opening restaurants. His companies began catering for top state officials, bringing him close to President Putin’s circle.\n\nBy the early 2000s Prigozhin had earned the nickname “Putin’s chef” thanks to catering contracts for the Kremlin and the army. He later expanded into media, logistics and overseas projects. Prigozhin also became known as the organiser of the “troll factory,” accused of election interference and information campaigns abroad.\n\nHe gained greatest notoriety through his connection with the Wagner Group, a private military company active in Syria, Libya, the CAR and Donbas. After years of denial he publicly acknowledged leading Wagner. His activities repeatedly triggered sanctions from the USA, EU and others.\n\nBy 2022 Yevgeny Prigozhin remained an influential and controversial figure: Kremlin-linked businessman, head of non-state military forces and media assets, deeply involved in Russia’s geopolitical operations abroad."

RAMZAN_KADYROV_DESCRIPTION: "Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov was born on 5 October 1976 in the village of Tsentaroy, Chechen-Ingush ASSR. He is the son of Akhmat Kadyrov, Chechnya’s mufti who initially backed independence in the 1990s and later sided with Russia. During the Second Chechen War Ramzan fought alongside federal troops, commanding a unit against insurgents.\n\nAfter his father became head of Chechnya in the 2000s, Ramzan was appointed to the presidential security service. In 2004 Akhmat Kadyrov was killed in a terrorist attack. Ramzan became de facto leader of Chechnya and, with Vladimir Putin’s support, was formally appointed head of the republic in 2007.\n\nUnder Kadyrov, Chechnya embarked on large-scale reconstruction, but his rule has been marked by allegations of severe human-rights abuses, repression and a clan-based power system. He has built a cult of personality, openly proclaims loyalty to Putin and advocates harsh measures against opponents.\n\nBy 2022 Kadyrov remained the unchallenged leader of Chechnya, ruling the region with broad autonomy and a strong security apparatus. He actively joined Russian political and military initiatives, styling himself as Putin’s loyal “footsoldier.”"

ANJI_DUDA_DESCRIPTION: "Andrzej Sebastian Duda was born on 16 May 1972 in Kraków, Poland. His parents were academics; he graduated with honours from the Jagiellonian University’s Faculty of Law, later lecturing there. In the early 2000s he worked in governmental and legal bodies, edging toward politics.\n\nFrom 2005 Duda joined the right-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) and in 2006 became deputy minister of justice. He later represented Poland in the European Parliament. A reliable party cadre, he enjoyed strong backing from PiS leaders.\n\nIn 2015 Andrzej Duda unexpectedly won the presidential election, defeating incumbent Bronisław Komorowski. His victory signalled a new national-conservative course for Poland with greater state involvement. In 2020 he was re-elected after a tense campaign.\n\nDuda fostered close ties with the United States, championed NATO reinforcement and adopted a hard line toward Russia. Critics, however, accused him of undermining democratic institutions through pressure on the judiciary and media. By 2022 he remained a pivotal figure in Polish politics, balancing loyalty to PiS with international commitments."
VLADIMIR_ZELENSKY_DESCRIPTION: "Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy was born on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian SSR. Trained as a lawyer, he graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University but never practiced. While still a student he joined KVN comedy competitions, becoming a popular comedian and co-founder of the studio Kvartal 95, whose satirical shows gained wide fame across the CIS.\n\nZelenskyy became one of the most recognizable performers on Ukrainian television. In 2015 he starred in the TV series *Servant of the People*, playing a humble teacher who unexpectedly becomes president. The image of an honest, incorruptible leader resonated with millions and later formed the basis of his real political campaign.\n\nIn 2018 Zelenskyy announced his bid for the Ukrainian presidency under the newly created *Servant of the People* party. In 2019 he won a landslide victory, securing over 70 percent of the vote in the second round. As president he called for a reboot of government, a fight against corruption, and a peaceful settlement of the Donbas conflict.\n\nZelenskyy soon faced severe challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic political crises, and escalating tensions with Russia. By early 2022 his ratings fluctuated, yet he remained popular as a representative of a new generation of Ukrainian politicians and a symbol of change."
