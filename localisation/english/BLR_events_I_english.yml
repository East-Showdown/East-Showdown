blr.1.t: "The trial of Grigory Kostusev"
blr.1.desc: "Grigory Andreyevich Kostusev is a Belarusian politician, the head of the Mogilev regional Coalition of Democratic Forces, and the head of the Belarusian Popular Front Party since 2017. He was detained by the Belarusian KGB at his home in Shklov on April 12, 2021, and then placed in a detention center in Minsk. He is charged with conspiracy to seize power in Belarus, organized by two other defendants in the case, Yury Zenkovich and Dmitry Shchigelsky. According to the accusation, Kostusev reached a secret agreement with Zenkovich and Shchigelsky to seize power unconstitutionally and agreed with their arguments that these goals could only be achieved by violent means. The charges against Kostusev, which the prosecutor read out, include facts that had already been read out during the reading of the charges to Ziankovich and Feduta, including that the conspirators were planning to assassinate the head of state and were also asking the US military industrial complex to provide them with 10 million dollars for a military coup in Belarus. The prosecutor read out the indictment to Kostusev for more than half an hour. "I plead not guilty," said Kastusiou in court. Minsk Court sentenced Ryhor Kastusiou to 10 years in prison."
blr.1.a: "There he goes."
blr.2.t: "Situation of Belarus at the beginning of 2022"
blr.2.desc: "So the year 2022 is upon us. Slightly less than a year ago, mass protests over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election subsided in the country. The political situation in the country remains unstable, as evidenced by the same conspiracy involving Grigory Kostusev, although it has been exposed. The economy, unlike the political situation, is quite stable, with falling unemployment, rising industrial output, and GDP itself growing by about 2.5 percent. But amid the recent deterioration of Russian-Ukrainian relations, the country is faced with the question of who to join in the coming conflict. After all, it is becoming clearer every day that there will be no peaceful solution..."
blr.2.a: "Well, let's hope all will be well."
blr.3.t: "Reaction to SMOs in Belarus"
blr.3.desc: "Um, we've had some disturbing reports that Russia is about to invade Ukraine. Yes, of course we assumed it would happen, but no one thought it would happen now. The Russian Federation demands our territory for the passage of their troops, and we can't refuse them... But on the other hand, the Ukrainians are our brothers, and we cannot support aggression against them either. We have three options - the first is to allow the Russian troops to pass through, but to maintain relative neutrality, at least for the time being. The second option is to refuse to provide territory to the RF Armed Forces and then start a joint action with Ukraine against Russia, this option seems insane, but it may turn out to be the right one... And the third option is to maintain neutrality, in which we will refuse the RF Armed Forces, but we will not help Ukraine either. This is probably the most unpredictable option, after which anything can happen."
blr.3.a: "We cannot betray our brothers"
blr.3.b: "We have no other choice..."
blr.3.c: "Let's look at the situation."
