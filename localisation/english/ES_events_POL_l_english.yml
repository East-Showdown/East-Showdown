I extend my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost loved ones...\n\nOn this special day I wish that, despite the issues dividing us and the strong emotions that often accompany them, we can talk to one another, shake hands and smile.

pol.23.d: "After extensive operations against pro-Russian influence networks, nearly all evidence points to the need to ban this party, which, our probe shows, actively aids hostile agents. Shall we outlaw it for good, or deem it harmless?"

pol.24.t: "Ukrainians Cross Poland’s Border"
pol.24.d: "Overnight our guards observed activity from Zakarpattia, Lviv and Volyn: refugees fleeing war and mobilisation. Many trekked through forests to reach weak spots.

We must ask the United States to modernise our defences—specifically, to obtain Patriot PAC-3 batteries and a long-term THAAD deployment.\nIt will be costly, but the price of inaction is counted in millions of lives."
pol.35.a: "All for homeland defence"

pol.36.t: "Ukrainian Refugee Murdered"
pol.36.d: "Our nation has been struck to its core: a Ukrainian refugee was killed in Lublin. Early reports blame unknown Polish extremists. As a nation we must respond decisively.\nThis is a tragedy not only human but moral. We opened our doors to millions of Ukrainians, and most Poles met the challenge with honour.

pol.37.t: "Poland has seized territory in western Ukraine!"
pol.37.d: "As a result of a rapid advance, Polish troops entered the western regions of Ukraine, seized by the USSR in 1939. The mood of the locals is mixed: some greet the Polish army as liberators and saviors from endless war, while others fear the imposition of a new Sanation regime."
pol.37.a: "Pilsudski's ideas live on!"
pol.37.b: "It is urgent to launch a humanitarian mission in the region to prevent chaos!"

pol_falanga.1.t: "Strange Arson in Lublin"
pol_falanga.1.d: "Fire-fighters barely contained a blaze at a warehouse of aid for Ukrainian refugees. On site they found a petrol cylinder wrapped in black-and-red tape with a stylised sword-ploughshare—the pre-war Falanga emblem. Police think the act was planned to go unnoticed, but shifting winds betrayed the arsonists.\nNote: If this was Russian sabotage, GRU may be disguising itself as ‘Falanga’."
