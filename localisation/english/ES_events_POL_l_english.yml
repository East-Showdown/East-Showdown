I extend my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost loved ones...\n\nOn this special day I wish that, despite the issues dividing us and the strong emotions that often accompany them, we can talk to one another, shake hands and smile.

pol_falanga.1.d: "Fire-fighters barely contained a blaze at a warehouse of aid for Ukrainian refugees. On site they found a petrol cylinder wrapped in black-and-red tape with a stylised sword-ploughshare—the pre-war Falanga emblem. Police think the act was planned to go unnoticed, but shifting winds betrayed the arsonists.\nNote: If this was Russian sabotage, GRU may be disguising itself as ‘Falanga’."
pol_falanga.1.a: "Police will investigate"

pol_falanga.2.t: "Night Fire at Refugee Centre"
pol_falanga.2.d: "On Lublin’s outskirts flames engulfed a modular shelter housing women and children.
