DPR.5.t: "SSO MGB Raid on a HUR Cell in Donetsk"
DPR.5.desc: "In a carefully planned and prepared operation, the Special Operations Forces of the DPR Ministry of State Security successfully tracked and eliminated a cell of Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) in Donetsk. Thanks to the professionalism and decisive actions of our security services, we thwarted a major sabotage plot that could have had severe consequences for both civilians and key strategic facilities of our Republic. The agents we captured—and the documents we seized—will provide vital intelligence for continuing the fight against Ukrainian reconnaissance and sabotage networks on our territory."
DPR.5.a: "Burn out the vermin"

DPR.6.t: "Offensive in Donbas Stalls"
DPR.6.desc: "Since the start of the Special Military Operation, despite every effort, the Russian Armed Forces and the DPR People’s Militia have suffered heavy losses and failed to make deep advances in Donbas. Fierce resistance from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the enemy’s well-fortified positions have greatly impeded our offensive actions. Supply and logistics problems have made matters worse. We also underestimated the partisan activity of supporters of the Kyiv junta, which has caused major trouble in our rear. We must learn from this experience and strengthen our forces for the battles ahead."
DPR.6.a: "Something is going wrong..."

DPR.7.t: "Liberation of Donbas!"
DPR.7.desc: "After the launch of the Special Military Operation, combined forces of the Russian Armed Forces, the DPR People’s Militia and the LPR People’s Militia carried out a series of major offensives that completely liberated Donetsk Oblast from neo-Nazi armed formations. The advance showed high coordination and determination, breaking the resistance of the Kyiv junta and restoring control over cities occupied by Ukraine. The liberation of Donbas marks a milestone for our Republic, finally bringing peace and freedom to local residents after eight long years of genocide. This day will stand as a symbol of our resolve and remind all of the strength of the Russian Spring."
DPR.7.a: "Donbas is ours—and God is with us!"

DPR.1.t: "Happy New Year, Donetsk!"
DPR.1.desc: "On 1 January 2022 fireworks light up every city of the Republic; amid bright decorations and good cheer the Republic steps into the New Year. As the Kremlin chimes echo from Red Square, the recent autumn shellings, the concrete barricades at the front, the casualties along the line of contact, and the pandemic restrictions are momentarily forgotten. On Lenin Square in Donetsk, in dugouts near Staromykhailivka and the airport, and in every flat, people believe that this year will be a happy one for all residents of the Republic."
DPR.1.a: "Happy New Year!"

DPR.8.t: "If War Comes Tomorrow..."
DPR.8.desc: "The horizon is not yet overcast, but the Republic’s position is precarious. After the recent spring escalation no full-scale battles followed, yet the growing activity of the AFU along the entire contact line is hard to miss. Our sources report a many-fold build-up of enemy strength—contrary to the Minsk Agreements. Ukrainian drones increasingly violate DPR airspace; the SBU squeezes more information from our citizens about administrative and military sites; Ukraine’s border guards ask ever stranger questions of those crossing into non-Kyiv-controlled territories; OSCE observers take a keener interest in 1st Army Corps positions and show up where they clearly should not. Meanwhile unofficial channels linked to the DPR militia warn that our forces are far from peak strength."
DPR.8.a: "It would be reckless to ignore this"

DPR.2.t: "Death of Volodymyr Zhoga"
DPR.2.desc: "Colonel Volodymyr Artyomovych Zhoga, commander of the separate Sparta Reconnaissance Battalion, has been killed. Volodymyr has been with us since the very start of our struggle to free Donbas. He fought at Donetsk Airport, Sloviansk, Shakhtarsk and Snizhne, was wounded many times, yet always returned to protect his comrades. After the war with the Kyiv regime began, Zhoga was among our army’s leading fighters—until vile Nazis shot him near Volnovakha while he was evacuating civilians. A farewell ceremony for this hero of Donbas will be held at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre. Russia’s leadership has promised to honour Volodymyr as a true defender of the Russian World."
DPR.2.a: "Rest in peace"

DPR.3.t: "Strelkov Returns"
DPR.3.desc: "The headquarters of the DPR People’s Militia has received a message from I. I. Girkin-Strelkov requesting to re-enter its ranks. Igor Ivanovich led our forces from the outset of the fight against the Kyiv neo-Nazis and repeatedly proved his commitment on the battlefield. After stepping down as defence minister, however, he left the country; living in Moscow, he frequently criticised the current leadership of the DPR and LPR and Russia’s policy toward Ukraine. Although Girkin is a veteran and an experienced commander, he is first and foremost a traitor who has not returned to Donbas in eight years and lives comfortably in Russia. What shall we do with him?"
DPR.3.a: "He could be very useful"
DPR.3.b: "We don’t need such ‘patriots’"

novorossia_form_tt: "Novorossiya will be formed."

DPR.4.t: "Creation of Novorossiya"
DPR.4.desc: "Novorossiya will be formed from the DPR and LPR."
DPR.4.a: "Approved"

novorossia_suchestvuet: "Novorossiya exists"

LPR.8.t: "Luhansk New Year"
LPR.8.desc: "The year has been difficult for the Luhansk People’s Republic: economic problems and internal political rifts darken life, and regular clashes along the front line offer little optimism. Yet all hope that the coming year will be calmer than the last."
LPR.8.a: "Happy New Year, Luhansk!"

LPR.2.t: "Purge of Brigade Commanders"
LPR.2.desc: "The recent purges in the command ranks have produced tangible results, but some officers still arouse suspicion of disloyalty and insufficient commitment. Continuing the purges could strengthen discipline and eliminate potential threats."
LPR.2.a: "Yes—continue the purges!"
LPR.2.b: "We can’t destroy the army’s backbone."

LPR.3.t: "The Mozgovoy–Kostin Case"
LPR.3.a: "Rehabilitate Mozgovoy"
LPR.3.b: "Leave matters as they are"
LPR.3.desc: "Aleksey Mozgovoy remains one of the most controversial figures in recent LPR history. His activities—and the circumstances of his death—are still debated. Some call him a hero who fought for justice and independence; others see him as a threat who destabilised the region. In today’s unstable climate and new challenges, should we revisit his case and reconsider earlier conclusions?"

LPR.4.t: "Reviewing the 2015 Cases"
LPR.4.a: "Re-examine and soften sentences"
LPR.4.b: "Uphold the hard line and confirm past decisions"
LPR.4.desc: "In 2015, at the height of the conflict, many measures were taken to cement power and suppress opposition. With time, some of those decisions appear questionable, and the actions of certain commanders and politicians face criticism. Given the changed situation and new evidence, the LPR leadership has decided to review several cases from that period. This could lead either to a softer stance or to an even tougher line, depending on the findings."

LPR.5.t: "Considering Decree 757 in the LPR"
LPR.5.a: "Adopt the decree"
LPR.5.b: "It’s not time yet..."
LPR.5.desc: "The government is preparing to introduce Decree 757, adjusting domestic policy for wartime conditions. Already in force in the Russian Federation, the decree imposes restrictions aimed at bolstering security and control during the conflict. Yet its introduction in the LPR has sparked debate. Officials cite the need to protect citizens, but some fear infringements on rights and freedoms and tighter state control over movement and speech. The government is now weighing the decree and will soon decide its fate."

LPR.6.t: "Battalion Commanders’ Revolt"
LPR.6.desc: "After the purge of commanders in the People’s Militia and a series of high-profile dismissals, many veteran units refuse to fight at the urging of their ‘former’ leaders. Loyal commanders try to curb the mass desertion, yet cannot disarm the mutineers. Pasechnik has branded all rebels traitors and sentenced the ringleaders to death in absentia. He has also appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin for help. The People’s Militia has effectively ceased to be a cohesive force, and quelling the revolt will take time."
LPR.6.a: "Kyiv’s lackeys!"

LPR.7.t: "Heroes of the Native Spoil Tips"
LPR.7.desc: "The recruitment drive for contract volunteers to the SMO zone has exceeded all expectations: in just the first week over four thousand people joined Luhansk’s valiant army. Training grounds are forging new heroes ready to give their lives to free their homeland and wipe out the surviving Nazis from the West."
LPR.7.a: "They are performing the greatest feat..."

LPR.1.t: "Luhansk People’s Republic"
LPR.1.desc: "In March 2014, amid the coup in Kyiv and ensuing chaos, the people of Luhansk voiced their discontent and concern over the new regime’s actions. The new Ukrainian government’s radical nationalist stance alarmed the Russian-speaking population of the east.\n\nThat spring, mass protests erupted in Luhansk against the Kyiv regime and its anti-Russian policies. Later, in response to brutal reprisals by Ukrainian nationalists, the Luhansk People’s Republic was proclaimed. The people of Luhansk rose to defend themselves and their land.\n\nTogether with Donetsk, the Luhansk Republic became a symbol of the Russian World’s revival. A free and open referendum was held, in which an overwhelming majority voted for independence from Ukraine. But Kyiv’s nationalists, egged on by their Western masters, waged war on the peaceful population of Donbas, seeking to eradicate Russian people and culture.\n\nDespite the offensive actions of the Ukrainian armed formations, LPR militiamen held the line and defended their cities from the Banderite blood-suckers. After the Minsk Agreements, the situation slowly stabilised. For eight years we have sought international recognition to stop the Kyiv junta’s genocide of the Russian-speaking population. Yet the situation is again becoming dangerously tense. Only a single spark is needed to reignite the conflict—and it seems Russia is ready to strike the match..."
LPR.1.a: "The year promises to be interesting"
