 utils.1.desc: "Attention! You have started the game session §Rwithout enabling important optimizing games rules at the session start screen, what can significantly affect the speed and smoothness of the game!§! \n\nYou can enable optimizing game rules right now by selecting the \"§OOptimize my game session right now§!\" option, or when you start the next game session by clicking on the \"Custom game rules\" button in the lower right corner of the game sessions start screen. Optimization game rules can be found in the \"East Showdown Rules\" section. \n\nA brief description of the optimization game rules: \n\n§B\"Russia's Back Areas(Optimization)\"§! - currently unused territories far inside the borders of the Russian Federation will be transfered to a separate unplayable country. That will significantly speed up the game. All resources, factories, population etc from the disabled states will be transferred to Russia. \n\n§B\"NATO Status (Optimization)\"§! - all European countries that are members of NATO (except for Poland) will be united into one NATO country. If you choose the \"Main Base (High)\" option, almost all of the states of the unified NATO, except for it's main base and surrounding state (and also Poland), will be transferred to a separate non-playable country. That will greatly speed up the game. All resources, factories, population etc from disabled states will be transferred to NATO.\n\n§B\"Disable small countries\"§! - Serbia, Bosnia, Abkhazia and Kazakhstan will be removed from the game map. That will have a positive impact on game optimization."
