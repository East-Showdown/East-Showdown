Achieving results at the front depends on the help of citizens; victories in wars are made on the home front. Understanding this, we must expand the work of volunteer centers, but it should be understood that complete freedom for rear-guards can play a cruel joke, giving an excuse for corruption, theft, and espionage. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate the status of “Volunteer” at the state level, creating a legislative basis for controlling the work process of people who help our soldiers, including a precise legal definition of “Volunteer”, the specified exact process of the organizations' activities, as well as the privileges given to volunteers. With this, we can succeed in reducing corruption, and we can better control the volunteer process. “RPA (Russian Rebel Army), and on its basis create a new unit ‘RDK’."

To realize this, we will adopt a set of measures that will consist of redeployment, camouflage and nationalization of strategically important production facilities.

Since the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the army has been putting in its best work, conducting operations on land, sea and air. We are standing on our feet because of it, with opinion polls showing unprecedented results in the popularity of the army and its commanders. Nevertheless, we should not cover our heads with laurel wreaths, we should not become conceited, as we had and have some unresolved problems. The Armed Forces of Ukraine need to continue reforms and use the experience gained in the course of combat operations. The mentioned reforms should contain systemic changes. As military history, in particular Sun Tzu himself, shows, it is important to know the enemy and know yourself, and then you will be invincible."

Second_wave_of_mobilization_desc: "The war with Russia has been going on for quite some time. Despite the successes of the AFU, our army still does not have enough men to cover the entire front line. Every day hundreds of people die on the battlefields, and dozens are killed due to the mass bombing of cities. Let many people be dissatisfied, but in the heaviest war since World War II, the president must make important, albeit unpopular, decisions - we urgently need to start a second wave of mobilization throughout Ukraine, as well as reform the draft law on mobilization, because the current “wooden” laws not only do a poor job of recruiting people, but also cause serious unrest among potential mobilized. Not all patriots are willing to forfeit their lives, and forcibly sending people to the front can provoke a storm of resentment - citizens should be motivated to sign a contract by offering benefits to them and their families. Only through mobilization will we be able to keep the front longer"

Among the new formations will be brigades specializing in assault operations, sabotage and reconnaissance activities and other areas. This will significantly increase the combat effectiveness of our army by increasing the flexibility of its units."
Third_wave_of_mobilization: "Third wave of mobilization"
Third_wave_of_mobilization_desc: "After the second wave of mobilization, we have improved the shortage of people, but it is still not enough to win the war. Russia has a much stronger potential mobilization reserve because of its superior population. If the enemy manages to amass a vastly superior force, not only will we be unable to mount a full and effective counteroffensive, we risk seriously reducing the chances of successfully defending our territory. The occupiers are actively using the tactic of “meat assaults” and are actively using convicts on the battlefield who have been promised a pardon in exchange for service in the army. At this rate, the likelihood of our defeat may increase, despite the help of Western countries supplying us with high-quality weapons. As much as we don't want to worry the citizens, we urgently need to start a new wave of mobilization. We need to gather as many people as possible and as fast as possible, because in Russia mobilization causes much more resistance among Russians, giving no chance to the Moscow dictator to gather people in a quick time. In addition to mobilizing the population, it is worthwhile to use the Russians' tactic of using prisoners for mobilization purposes, but do it much smarter to prevent crime from increasing in the country. The situation is also difficult because of the large number of men of conscription age who have left the country and who are so badly missed at the front - it is necessary to motivate people to return to their homeland, possibly by introducing some repressive measures. No matter how much criticism is directed at"
Counter_Step_Guard: "Counter-Attack Guard"
Counter_Step_Guard_desc: "Strike units of the AFU, known as the “Counteroffensive Guard” or “Offensive Guard”, will be formed.

During the ATO they have demonstrated outstanding results, conducting successful operations even deep behind the lines of the separatist republics. The effectiveness and tactical flexibility of the SDF units have been proven many times. There is no doubt that their expansion will make our army even stronger."

Three waves of mobilization and a large flow of volunteers allowed us to form a large numerical potential, to form offensive brigades, and Western equipment is actively used by us in the war, preventing the enemy from conducting mass assaults. Now there must come a new period of the war, which could be a turning point in this bloody slaughter - the beginning of our large-scale counteroffensive. Brigades are formed, men are recruited, weapons are available. We will liberate our territories!"
GUR: "GUR"
GUR_desc: "In the 21st century, victory in wars is often achieved not on the battlefield. It is achieved by active intelligence, which will not only help us to predict the upcoming ways of the enemy's offensive, but will also make possible various subversive works, both in the temporarily occupied territories and on the territory of Russia - from undermining logistics routes and precise indication of military-industrial complex and air defense facilities, to the assassination of political and military figures important to the occupiers, who have authority in the eyes of the stunned people. And for this purpose we will increase the powers and activities of fighters from the Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), because the head of the GUR Kirill Budanov has proven himself with good results while fighting in Donbass"

Such operations will be aimed at identifying and neutralizing important facilities and targets of the Russian Federation, which will make it possible to significantly weaken their defenses and give our army an advantage."
Reform_Intelligence: "Reform intelligence"
Reform_Intelligence_desc: "At the moment, despite many successful operations, our intelligence department is inferior not only to the intelligence of NATO countries, which successfully predicted the invasion of Russia, but also to the Russian government itself. Intelligence has an important role in warfare, and with a significant lag in technology and skill, we stand a chance of being “blind” to the occupier's planned maneuvers. In the course of reforms, we will not only expand the number of GUR personnel, but will also be able to use drones in the air, which will point us to the locations of warehouses, air defense bases, important logistical routes, and the beginning regrouping of enemy troops"
Agent_Search: "Search for agents"
Agent_Search_desc: "The enemy's intelligence never slumbers. By actively using propaganda that pressures the feelings of people sympathetic to Russia, together with the presence of Russian citizens inside the country, Russia has created a situation where there are a sufficient number of agents in our country who have defected to the side of the enemy. Local “waiters” not only dishonor the future of Ukraine, but also actively leak information to their Moscow “customers”. This must be stopped immediately, the SBU must urgently arrest suspicious individuals, and set up searches for all spies, preventing future attempts to leak data. Only the most pathetic person is capable of betraying the future of his people, there is no place for traitors in Ukraine"
Fighting_gunners: "Fighting gunners"
Fighting_gunners_desc: "In Ukraine, many “waiters” not only provide information about the location of troops or engage in sabotage, but are also spotters. They mark special markings with paint to indicate strategically and militarily important locations, which allows the Russians to know the exact target when bombing. At the same time, the saboteurs provide the enemy with the locations of air defense guns, thanks to which the occupants continue their terrorist attacks. It is not only the SBU that should track down traitors, citizens of the country can help in the defense of their country if they are more vigilant to suspicious individuals. The population should be sensitized to the necessary assistance - “If you notice suspicious symbols on any surfaces in the city, immediately report them to the state authorities”. At the same time, photography and videotaping should be restricted in cities, especially for tourists"

We have a large number of Russians sympathizing with us serving in our troops since the war in Donbass, forming a whole battalion - the Russian Volunteer Corps. Also on the territory of Russia itself there are many honest people with opposition views, who are against the criminal war unleashed by their dictatorial regime. People who want to fight for the truth with weapons in their hands. They not only join RDK from time to time, but in the future they will be able to help us and the future of their country in the fight against the dictatorial regime of Europe."
Legion_of_Freedom_of_Russia: "Legion of Freedom of Russia"
Legion_of_Freedom_of_Russia_desc: "There are already a sufficient number of Russians serving in the ranks of the AFU, along with Ukrainians, who want to help us defend our independence. Since 2014 and the ATO, we have formed the RDK, which are fighters against the occupiers. In addition to helping in the war, they are a serious political opposition who want to overthrow Putin's regime for the good of the world. But one corps, ideologically composed of people of right-wing and ultra-right-wing views, will not be enough. For this we can create another battalion of Russians, which fulfills the same role in the war on Russia as the RDK - helping for a speedy victory and fighting the dictatorship inside their own country. The Russian Freedom Legion will be their another home and way of being active politically. As they say, “Glory to Ukraine and Freedom to Russia!”"

Being under occupation, especially in areas that seceded from us 10 years ago, people with a preserved blue and yellow body can be seriously affected psychologically by the Russian propaganda surrounding them, which since 2014 has seriously brainwashed many former citizens of Ukraine. Zhovta strichka was created to combat this psychological decline. Volunteers hang pro-Ukrainian posters and yellow ribbon symbols, showing annexed Ukrainians, “You are not alone, we remember you. Liberation is coming soon!”. Sevastopol, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, and other occupied territories are sure to return home soon"

Atesh_desc: "In addition to Russians serving in our country, there are many other nations serving in Ukraine. The most serious blow to the state of our country is the Crimean Tatar peninsula - Crimea, which since 2014 has been occupied by Russia under the pretext of “protecting the Russian population” by holding its unrecognized and criminal “referendum”. During the annexation, the indigenous people of the peninsula, the Crimean Tatars, who face daily searches and repression in the enemy's territory, suffer the most. Therefore, we can create a guerrilla movement “Atesh” (from Crimean Tatar “Fire”), which will help us to save the repressed people sooner, returning Our Crimea to us"

Civil servants, so-called “Servants of the People” at the local and state level: sell off humanitarian aid provided to us by our Western allies, steal and sell on the black market the armament of our army, issue and approve tenders with huge sums of money for completely unnecessary changes for our country. If we do not start to fight this “plague”, our armed forces will simply have nothing to defend our Motherland from the enemy, and our state will simply not have enough money to exist.

Utilizing Starlink will allow us to significantly improve operational communications in our Armed Forces by providing fast and high quality Internet access regardless of geographic location. This will enable us to quickly transfer data, coordinate actions and exchange information, which will ultimately increase the efficiency and security of our military operations."

Insist_on_closing_the_sky_desc: "Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will hold talks with the USA and NATO countries to introduce a no-fly zone over the territory of Ukraine. This is necessary to protect civilians from air raids by Russian aircraft, which struck hundreds of civilian objects in the first days of the war. The introduction of a no-fly zone implies a ban on overflight of military aircraft over the Ukrainian sky, which will not only reduce civilian casualties, but also deprive Russia of the opportunity to gain air superiority."
