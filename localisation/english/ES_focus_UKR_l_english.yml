National_focuses_of_Ukraine: "Ukraine’s National Focuses"

Eastern_crisis: "Eastern Crisis"
Eastern_crisis_desc: "As the famous strategist Carl von Clausewitz said, war is politics by other means. Russia annexed Crimea and waged a hybrid war against us in 2014. Since spring 2021, tensions with Russia have escalated; Western diplomatic efforts remain ineffective. Ukraine now stands on the brink of war with its eastern neighbor, and we must prepare for the worst despite some skepticism."

Meeting_of_the_countrys_high_command: "Meeting of the Country’s High Command"
Meeting_of_the_countrys_high_command_desc: "No one can guarantee that Russia will not invade and escalate further. Even if Moscow’s current aggression causes little damage for now, and our Western allies offer only words, we must do everything possible to prepare. We will convene an urgent meeting of the highest military leadership to unveil our national defense plan and implement key reforms across our armed forces."

Beyond reforming units to NATO standards, we will launch large-scale drills to rehearse defense of our cities. We will integrate land, air, and naval forces to practice coordinated defense and counter-strikes—not only on enemy ground forces but also against possible amphibious and aerial assaults. On paper, Russia appears stronger, but we will do everything to prevent a blitzkrieg."

Preparing_for_TRO_Deployment: "Prepare Territorial Defense Forces Deployment"
Preparing_for_TRO_Deployment_desc: "With our main forces concentrated along the Russian border and in the ‘Republics,’ we cannot allow enemy sea or air operations on our territory. Given the Black Sea Fleet’s superiority, cities like Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Odesa face high risk of amphibious assault. We will reform and equip our Regional Defense Forces in every oblast. These units will defend against conventional attacks, safeguard critical infrastructure, organize civilian resistance, and run partisan operations in occupied areas."

Raise_the_entire_composition_of_the_MTR_desc: "Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces (SOF) include special-purpose units and information-psychological warfare detachments.

Attention_the_equipment_of_the_AFU_is_moving_desc: "“We anticipate a Russian offensive soon, so we must move our forces to the border and keep them combat-ready. Priority goes to concealed troop movements, even if civilian roads must be restricted. That’s preferable to deploying unprepared forces to face the enemy.”"

Prepare_aviation: "Secure and Disperse Our Air Force"
Prepare_aviation_desc: "Russia possesses extensive missile arsenals inherited from Soviet times and continues to expand them. In war, Russian command will ruthlessly target our border airfields.

Strengthen_the_eastern_territories: "Fortify the Eastern Regions"
Strengthen_the_eastern_territories_desc: "We cannot build a Maginot or Siegfried Line overnight. The ‘European Wall’ or ‘Yatsenyuk Line’ has proven ineffective, plagued by corruption.

UKR_Revive_Ammo_Prod: "Revive Ammunition Production"
UKR_Revive_Ammo_Prod_prod: "Trouble has come from where we least expected. The careless practice of 'disarmament' or the destruction of Soviet-era ammunition has played a cruel joke on us. We don’t know how long the stockpiled munitions will last in the upcoming large-scale war. Given this situation, we must take urgent action to recommission ammunition production lines, with a focus on shells for tube artillery, mortars, and all types of grenade launchers."

Preparation_for_landings: "Prepare for Amphibious Landings"

Verkhovna_Rada_Association: "United Verkhovna Rada"
Verkhovna_Rada_Association_desc: "In the face of aggression, our institutions must remain stable.

UKR_Personnel_changes_in_General_Staff_desc: "Out with the soviet-era brass, in with agile, modern commanders able to fight a 21st-century war."

UKR_Give_recruitment_freedom_to_well_known_brigades: "Brigade-Led Recruitment"
UKR_Give_recruitment_freedom_to_well_known_brigades_desc: "Scrap discredited draft offices—let famous brigades raise volunteers regionally, tapping motivation and local ties."

UKR_Ukrainian_PMC_desc: "Private military companies can tackle special tasks at the front and behind enemy lines when the regular army is overstretched."

UKR_Transition_to_corps_structure: "Adopt Corps Organisation"
UKR_Transition_to_corps_structure_desc: "Replace scattered brigades with coherent corps, boosting coordination, logistics and firepower."

UKR_Staff_reduction: "Trim HQ Overhead"
UKR_Staff_reduction_desc: "Fire redundant generals, cut duplicate desks and shred paperwork to speed command cycles."

UKR_Reforming_Operational_Command: "Reform Operational Command"
UKR_Reforming_Operational_Command_desc: "New comms, NATO liaison and field autonomy will turn our OTs into a truly modern war-fighting network."

UKR_Zelensky: "Polish Zelensky’s Image"
UKR_Zelensky_desc: "With opposition banned, public unrest is brewing. Extra resources will reinforce the President’s reputation at home and abroad."
UKR_Reznikovs_time_is_up: "Reznikov’s Time Is Up"
UKR_Reznikovs_time_is_up_desc: "Oleksii Reznikov offered a brief island of stability at the Defence Ministry, yet soldiers never loved him and his office became mired in scandals — from the infamous ‘eggs for 17 hryvnias’ to inflated procurement bills. In wartime Ukraine cannot afford doubts or corruption: NATO partners must see clean hands. Reznikov will be replaced by a more pragmatic figure."

UKR_Joint_Operations_of_SBU_and_GUR: "SBU–GUR Joint Operations"
UKR_Joint_Operations_of_SBU_and_GUR_desc: "State Security (SBU) and Defence Intelligence (GUR) fuse their networks for high-impact missions: sabotage behind enemy lines, cyber-raids, extraction of key assets and counter-spy hunts inside Ukraine."

UKR_Coordination_of_MTR_with_foreign_MTR: "Coordinate SOF with Western SOF"
UKR_Coordination_of_MTR_with_foreign_MTR_desc: "From day one Ukraine’s Special-Operations Forces have trained shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO units. We deepen this link yet keep strategic autonomy: shared drills, joint target lists, real-time sat-feeds and rapid medevac pipelines."

UKR_form_RDK_LCR: "Form the RDK & LSR"
UKR_form_RDK_LCR_desc: "Russian dissidents and exiles — from Denis Kapustin to Ilya Ponomaryov — swarm to Ukraine. We organise them into two volunteer units: the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) and the Legion ‘Freedom for Russia’ (LSR). Their mission: fight the Kremlin today, decide Russia’s future tomorrow."

UKR_Residual_OPFL: "Fate of the OPFL Remnants"
UKR_Residual_OPFL_desc: "The banned pro-Russian OPFL left only confused rank-and-file. Some may atone and serve Ukraine; others must stand trial. A strict filter will sift deluded voters from conscious collaborators. No fifth column will ever grow again."

UKR_MEDIA_Areztovich: "Nation’s Calmer-in-Chief"
UKR_MEDIA_Areztovich_desc: "Oleksii Arestovych became the soothing nightly voice of the nation. His streams debunked Kremlin lies, guided volunteers, channelled aid and reminded Ukrainians: fear is natural, victory inevitable. We institutionalise his outreach as a strategic morale arm."

UKR_United24: "United24"
UKR_United24_desc: "The state-run United24 platform unites global donors, funnels money straight into defence, de-mining and medical kits, and publishes every receipt. Trust plus transparency equals billions for victory."

UKR_NEW_guerrilla_methods: "New Guerrilla Tactics"
UKR_NEW_guerrilla_methods_desc: "Russian columns press forward; every village now forges Molotovs. Government will arm, train and coordinate civilian defence squads, turning each lane into a death-trap for invaders. ‘Fight — and you shall prevail!’"

UKR_city_fortress: "City–Fortress Doctrine"
UKR_city_fortress_desc: "Organised urban defence stalls Russian blitzkrieg. Heavy weapons dig into high-rises while civilians supply intel and logistics. Each city buys precious time for regular forces to regroup and counter-strike."

UKR_Interna_legion_TRO: "Territorial Defence International Legion"
UKR_Interna_legion_TRO_desc: "We formalise a foreign-volunteer branch inside the Territorial Defence: contracts, insurance, NATO-grade gear and legal status for thousands of allies from every continent."

Call_to_the_oligarch: "Call the Oligarchs"
Call_to_the_oligarch_desc: "A late-night ring to every tycoon: planes, armour plates, diesel and drones — pay up or be named and shamed. Their fortunes must serve the front."

Give_weapon_to_police: "Arm the National Police"
Give_weapon_to_police_desc: "Patrol units, Security Police and KORD teams receive assault rifles, AT-launchers and body-armour. They guard cities, smash saboteur cells and back the army in street combat."

UKR_MIC_revise: "Audit the Defence-Industry"

UKR_contract_for_young: "‘Contract for the Young’"
UKR_contract_for_young_desc: "A 12-month enlistment for 18-24-year-olds: ₴1 million payout, guaranteed university seat and career perks. Voluntary service, not forced sacrifice."

UKR_mobilization_of_the_color_of_the_nation: "Drafting the Nation’s Best and Brightest"

Increase_Artem_Factory_desc: "The factory produces vital anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) for the front, which allow us to neutralize the advantage of Russian forces in tanks and repel mechanized assaults with minimal losses. Opening new workshops, purchasing modern equipment and hiring additional personnel will significantly increase missile production, which will substantially improve the situation on the front."
Increase_XKBM_Factory_desc: "Ukraine's largest tank factory Kharkiv Tank Plant at the beginning of the war was in decline, and only the counter-terrorist operation in 2014 on Donbass prevented it from completely ceasing operations. In modern conditions, such an enterprise becomes key to the defense of the country. It is necessary to restore full operations of the factory, build new workshops and move part of production capacity underground to increase their protection."
UKR_create_tank_center_desc: "Transfer of repair and training facilities to Western countries will protect them from enemy strikes, improve and accelerate crew training, ensuring stable restoration of armored vehicles. In addition, this will improve the equipment itself through consultations with Western specialists."
UKR_develop_novator2_desc: "Combat experience showed that the front requires a more protected and versatile vehicle. 'Novator-2' will be our answer to new threats, combining mobility, armor and adaptation to diverse tasks."
UKR_end_pre_war_contracts_desc: "Old contracts signed before the full-scale war do not meet the realities of the front. The state must finally close old obligations and redirect resources to where they are needed right now - on the altar of victory."
UKR_MIC_revise_desc: "Troops have been sending critical reviews about the quantity and quality of equipment coming from our military factories. Our military-industrial complex, mired in corruption, needs thorough auditing to improve the quality and efficiency of production."

Just remember the Kyiv Armored Plant, Kharkiv Morozov Plant, Malyshev Factory and others. By reviving production and engineering personnel, we will be able not only to repair the old, but also to create the new - to meet modern warfare needs."
UKR_Revive_Ammo_Prod_desc: "Trouble came from an unexpected quarter. The practice of mindless 'disarmament', or destruction of Soviet ammunition, played a cruel trick on us. We don't know how long the ammunition stockpiles will last in the coming big war. Given this circumstance, we must take urgent measures to recommission ammunition production lines, with an emphasis on shells for barrel artillery, mortars and grenade launchers of all types."
UKR_smoking_gg: "§RSmoking§! on the territory of the Russian Federation"
UKR_standartization_btr_desc: "The variety of modifications complicates the maintenance of this equipment. A solution was found: standardization of production will accelerate output, crew training and reduce the burden on logistics, which is poor in conditions of modern drone warfare."
UKR_standartization_on_T64_T80_desc: "Despite their age, T-64 and T-80 tanks showed themselves quite effectively on the battlefields. Deep modernization of electronics, protection and armament will allow us to strengthen and return them to battle as a formidable striking force."
UKR_standartization_on_T72_desc: "T-72 remains the most massive tank not only in Ukraine and Russia, but throughout the post-Soviet region. Installing modern optics and strengthening protection will turn it into a reliable workhorse for a long war of attrition."
UKR_support_army_volunteers_desc: "Support for Army Volunteers"
UKR_transfer_of_BTR4_production_desc: "The constant threat of missile strikes forces us to disperse production. Relocation of BTR-4 assembly to the western part of the country will make it possible to maintain equipment production even under threat to our military industry."
