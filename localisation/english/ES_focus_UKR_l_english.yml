Eastern_crisis: "Eastern Crisis"
Eastern_crisis_desc: "As the famous strategist Carl von Clausewitz said, war is politics by other means. Russia annexed Crimea and waged a hybrid war against us in 2014. Since spring 2021, tensions with Russia have escalated; Western diplomatic efforts remain ineffective. Ukraine now stands on the brink of war with its eastern neighbor, and we must prepare for the worst despite some skepticism."

Meeting_of_the_countrys_high_command_desc: "No one can guarantee that Russia will not invade and escalate further.

UKR_Ukrainian_PMC: "Legalise a Ukrainian PMC"
UKR_Ukrainian_PMC_desc: "Private military companies can tackle special tasks at the front and behind enemy lines when the regular army is overstretched."

UKR_Transition_to_corps_structure: "Adopt Corps Organisation"
UKR_Transition_to_corps_structure_desc: "Replace scattered brigades with coherent corps, boosting coordination, logistics and firepower."

UKR_Staff_reduction: "Trim HQ Overhead"
UKR_Staff_reduction_desc: "Fire redundant generals, cut duplicate desks and shred paperwork to speed command cycles."

UKR_Reforming_Operational_Command: "Reform Operational Command"
UKR_Reforming_Operational_Command_desc: "New comms, NATO liaison and field autonomy will turn our OTs into a truly modern war-fighting network."

UKR_Zelensky: "Polish Zelensky’s Image"
UKR_Zelensky_desc: "With opposition banned, public unrest is brewing. Extra resources will reinforce the President’s reputation at home and abroad."
UKR_Reznikovs_time_is_up: "Reznikov’s Time Is Up"
UKR_Reznikovs_time_is_up_desc: "Oleksii Reznikov offered a brief island of stability at the Defence Ministry, yet soldiers never loved him and his office became mired in scandals — from the infamous ‘eggs for 17 hryvnias’ to inflated procurement bills. In wartime Ukraine cannot afford doubts or corruption: NATO partners must see clean hands. Reznikov will be replaced by a more pragmatic figure."

UKR_Joint_Operations_of_SBU_and_GUR: "SBU–GUR Joint Operations"
UKR_Joint_Operations_of_SBU_and_GUR_desc: "State Security (SBU) and Defence Intelligence (GUR) fuse their networks for high-impact missions: sabotage behind enemy lines, cyber-raids, extraction of key assets and counter-spy hunts inside Ukraine."

UKR_Coordination_of_MTR_with_foreign_MTR: "Coordinate SOF with Western SOF"
UKR_Coordination_of_MTR_with_foreign_MTR_desc: "From day one Ukraine’s Special-Operations Forces have trained shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO units. We deepen this link yet keep strategic autonomy: shared drills, joint target lists, real-time sat-feeds and rapid medevac pipelines."

UKR_form_RDK_LCR: "Form the RDK & LSR"
UKR_form_RDK_LCR_desc: "Russian dissidents and exiles — from Denis Kapustin to Ilya Ponomaryov — swarm to Ukraine. We organise them into two volunteer units: the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) and the Legion ‘Freedom for Russia’ (LSR). Their mission: fight the Kremlin today, decide Russia’s future tomorrow."

UKR_Residual_OPFL: "Fate of the OPFL Remnants"
UKR_Residual_OPFL_desc: "The banned pro-Russian OPFL left only confused rank-and-file. Some may atone and serve Ukraine; others must stand trial. A strict filter will sift deluded voters from conscious collaborators. No fifth column will ever grow again."

UKR_MEDIA_Areztovich: "Nation’s Calmer-in-Chief"
UKR_MEDIA_Areztovich_desc: "Oleksii Arestovych became the soothing nightly voice of the nation. His streams debunked Kremlin lies, guided volunteers, channelled aid and reminded Ukrainians: fear is natural, victory inevitable. We institutionalise his outreach as a strategic morale arm."

UKR_United24: "United24"
UKR_United24_desc: "The state-run United24 platform unites global donors, funnels money straight into defence, de-mining and medical kits, and publishes every receipt. Trust plus transparency equals billions for victory."

UKR_city_fortress: "City–Fortress Doctrine"

Call_to_the_oligarch: "Call the Oligarchs"
Call_to_the_oligarch_desc: "A late-night ring to every tycoon: planes, armour plates, diesel and drones — pay up or be named and shamed. Their fortunes must serve the front."

Give_weapon_to_police: "Arm the National Police"
Give_weapon_to_police_desc: "Patrol units, Security Police and KORD teams receive assault rifles, AT-launchers and body-armour. They guard cities, smash saboteur cells and back the army in street combat."

UKR_support_army_volunteers: "Back the Army Volunteers"

UKR_MIC_revise: "Audit the Defence-Industry"

Check_ammo_stock_UKR: "Inspect Ammunition Depots"
Check_ammo_stock_UKR_desc: "Crack open every Soviet bunker, count each shell, tag each tank. Only a full inventory tells us how long we can fight."

UKR_contract_for_young: "‘Contract for the Young’"
UKR_contract_for_young_desc: "A 12-month enlistment for 18-24-year-olds: ₴1 million payout, guaranteed university seat and career perks. Voluntary service, not forced sacrifice."

UKR_mobilization_of_the_color_of_the_nation: "Drafting the Nation’s Best and Brightest"
UKR_mobilization_of_the_color_of_the_nation_desc: "Scientists, IT gurus and entrepreneurs now don uniforms. Intellectual loss is steep, yet the very existence of the state is at stake."
