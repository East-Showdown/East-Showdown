jihadism_desc: "§YJihadism§! - In a narrower sense, this refers to the belief that armed confrontation is a theologically legitimate method of socio-political change toward a Sharia-based system of governance. Ideologues of Jihadism present jihad as a 'revolutionary struggle' against the international order with the goal of uniting Muslims under Sharia law."
islam_nationalism: "Islamic Nationalism"
islam_nationalism_desc: "§YIslamic Nationalism§! - This is a form of religious nationalism that aims to advance the interests of Muslims by combining nationalism with Islamism. Critics argue that nationalism is inherently incompatible with Islam, as Islamism and Islamist ideology reject the Western concept of nation-states, which typically appeal to unity based on linguistic, cultural, ethnic, and territorial factors. Some Islamist organizations view the creation of a nation-state based on Sharia law as their goal, such as Kurdish Hezbollah, Hamas, or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham."

neofeudal_despotism_desc: "§YNeo-feudal Despotism§! - Chechnya has established a unique political order that combines elements of despotic power, tribal loyalty and ostentatious religious piety. The Republic is effectively governed as a personal holding of the ruling clan, and the formal institutions of power are subordinated to the will of the leader. Personal loyalty, power vertical and cult of personality have replaced party and ideological structures.\n\nChechnya demonstrates external loyalty to Moscow, but internally functions as an autonomous feudal principality of the 21st century."
