bridges_destroyed_news.0.t: "Collapse of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant"
bridges_destroyed_news.0.d: "A massive explosion has obliterated the Kyiv HPP. The dam gave way, unleashing a wall of water that inundated Kyiv’s riverfront districts, sweeping away homes, roads, and key infrastructure. Thousands have been evacuated; the capital’s entire power grid has failed, leaving the city without electricity or heat. Logistics are paralysed, and fuel- and food-supply chains are broken. As a cornerstone of the Dnipro hydro-cascade, the plant provided both electricity and water-flow regulation; its loss threatens chronic power shortages, malfunctions at downstream stations, and devastation of agriculture. Kyiv teeters on the edge of a humanitarian catastrophe, and recovery is impossible."

bridges_destroyed_news.1.t: "Explosion Destroys the Northern Bridge in Kyiv"
bridges_destroyed_news.1.d: "A catastrophic blast has completely demolished the Northern (Pivnichnyi) Bridge, the six-kilometre cable-stayed crossing that linked Obolon with Troieshchyna, Raduzhny, and Voskresenka. The 119-metre pylon and deck collapsed into the Dnipro, blocking the fairway. Northern Kyiv’s main artery is gone, paralysing traffic, cutting thousands of residents off from the city centre, and shutting down trolley-bus route 29. Congestion has choked alternative routes, and the regional economy is suffering. Rebuilding is impossible in the foreseeable future, promising chronic transport gridlock and heavier strain on the Metro and Paton bridges."

bridges_destroyed_news.2.t: "Explosion Destroys the Petrovskyi Rail Bridge in Kyiv"
bridges_destroyed_news.2.d: "A powerful blast has wiped out the 110-metre Petrovskyi rail bridge—an essential link in Kyiv’s Northern Ring. Its collapse severed rail traffic and partly blocked the river channel between Podil and Rybalskyi Island. Freight and passenger flows are paralysed, alternative routes over the Darnytskyi Bridge are jammed, and Kyiv’s economy is bleeding. Reconstruction is impossible any time soon, heralding long-term rail disruption, increased load on other crossings, and poorer access to industrial areas."

bridges_destroyed_news.3.t: "Explosion Destroys the Podilskyi Bridge Crossing in Kyiv"
bridges_destroyed_news.3.d: "A massive blast has levelled the unfinished 7.5-km Podilskyi bridge complex, designed to link Podil with Kyiv’s left bank via road and metro decks. Both levels collapsed into the Dnipro, halting river traffic and freezing future metro expansion. Thousands are cut off from the centre, logistics are paralysed, and remaining bridges are overstressed. Regional development plans have been derailed, and recovery is impossible in the near term."

bridges_destroyed_news.4.t: "Explosion Destroys Kyiv’s Metro Bridge"
bridges_destroyed_news.4.d: "A catastrophic explosion has shattered the unique 700-m Metro Bridge, whose twin decks carried both the Sviatoshynsko–Brovarska metro line and road traffic. The collapse severed the city, stranding tens of thousands of commuters and hampering river navigation. Kyiv faces huge economic losses from broken transport arteries. With no prospect of rebuilding, the metro faces chronic disruption and the burden on other bridges will skyrocket."

bridges_destroyed_news.5.d: "A powerful blast has annihilated the 1,543-m Paton Bridge—the world’s first all-welded bridge—linking Rusanyvka with central Kyiv. The collapse cut both road traffic and river navigation, plunging the capital’s network into chaos and isolating thousands. Alternative crossings are overwhelmed, logistics have stalled, and economic losses mount. With reconstruction impossible, long-term gridlock and severe strain on the Southern and Darnytskyi bridges are inevitable."

bridges_destroyed_news.7.t: "Explosion Destroys the Southern Bridge in Kyiv"
bridges_destroyed_news.7.d: "A massive explosion has levelled the 1.5-km Southern Bridge, which carried both road traffic and the Syretsko–Pecherska metro line between Vydubychi and Osokorky. Metro and cars alike are cut off, southern districts are isolated, and river navigation is blocked. Supply lines have failed and the local economy reels. With no rebuild possible, chronic metro disruption and overload on remaining crossings threaten Kyiv’s southern districts."

bridges_destroyed_news.8.d: "A powerful explosion has obliterated the Kaniv HPP—the second stage of the Dnipro cascade—on the Dnipro at Kaniv. The 675-km² Kaniv Reservoir has emptied in an uncontrolled flood, endangering riverside settlements and farmland. Over 20 resettled villages face re-inundation. The region’s power grid has collapsed, losing 444 MW forever. Locks and adjacent road-rail crossings are gone, paralysing transport. Downstream HPPs, including Kremenchuk, now face severe instability. Long-term results are catastrophic: chronic power shortages, ruined irrigation, agricultural losses, and a humanitarian crisis. Recovery is impossible, leaving Kaniv on the brink."
