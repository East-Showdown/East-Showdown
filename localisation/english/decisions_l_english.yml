RUS_go_na_voiny_desc: "Contract service is a form of military service where soldiers sign a contract for a specific period and receive a defined salary in return. This can be an attractive option for many people who want to serve their country. One way to promote contract service is through television. We can create informative and engaging commercials that highlight the benefits of contract service and the career development opportunities in the armed forces. These commercials can be aired on various TV channels and in different formats to attract as much attention as possible to this idea. Additionally, television can be used to organize special programs dedicated to military service and the armed forces as a whole. These programs could feature interviews with military experts and veterans who can share their service experience and draw attention to contract service. Thus, using television to promote contract service in our armed forces can become an effective way to strengthen our country's defense capabilities and attract new qualified personnel to the military."

RUS_genshtab_redoubt_picture_gs_delayed_desc: "§L'Redut' is the name of a network of volunteer units created under the cover of the Russian Ministry of Defense and effectively controlled by the GRU. Despite outward similarities to private military companies, Redut is not a PMC in the classical sense: its fighters are recruited via affiliated structures on contract, bypassing standard MoD mechanisms, yet remain under its direct control.\n\nThe project was launched as a way to rapidly form combat-ready units from former military personnel, volunteers, and mercenaries while avoiding bureaucratic procedures. Redut fighters receive weapons, supplies, and orders directly from military intelligence-linked structures. They take part in combat operations alongside regular troops, often undertaking high-risk missions, including deep reconnaissance, assault operations, and securing strategic directions.§!"
RUS_genshtab_redoubt_picture_1_gs_delayed_desc: "§LThe Volunteer Corps of the Russian Armed Forces was created to compensate for personnel losses and boost the army's offensive capabilities without launching an official mobilization.
