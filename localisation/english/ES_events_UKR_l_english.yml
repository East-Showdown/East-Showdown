ukr.1.t: "A Heavy Burden"
ukr.1.desc: "After Euromaidan and Russia’s seizure of Crimea and the Donbas, Ukraine’s position became extremely precarious. Over the years we managed to de-escalate the conflict in the east, build cooperation with Western nations and even reach limited compromises with Putin. Yet today Russia’s next move—and that of its regime—is more unpredictable than ever."
ukr.1.a: "What are we to do?"

ukr.2.t: "The Clouds Gather"
ukr.2.desc: "We stand on the brink of a new Russian invasion. It is pointless to deny what our intelligence services and the U.S. leadership keep repeating. Only one thing is unclear: how the intervention will unfold. Where will Putin’s army strike? Will war be formally declared? What will happen to the Donbas separatists? All that remains to government and nation alike is to prepare. We must defend our independence and our freedom."
ukr.2.a: "And who will help us?"

ukr.3.t: "A Ray of Light in the Darkness"
ukr.3.desc: "The main thing is—we are not alone. The entire Western, civilised world stands behind us, knowing full well that Putin’s Russia is the aggressor. They may be led by the nose, their economies tied to cheap Russian oil, but they will never stand aside from Ukraine. Unlike us, Putin has no true allies, and no one will aid him in the coming confrontation. Victory will be ours, for we are the whole world."
ukr.3.a: "Forward, Ukraine!"

ukr.5.t: "A Cry for Help to the West"
ukr.5.desc: "Ukrainian diplomats are tirelessly persuading Western countries of the need to assist and support Ukraine in its struggle for independence and territorial integrity. We appeal to the West with a cry for help, expecting active measures and solidarity at this decisive moment in our history. Our words carry not only an urgent plea but a deep conviction that our course—toward peace and freedom for all our citizens—is right. We are counting on you, West!"

ukr.17.t: "Russian Airborne Forces at Hostomel!"
ukr.17.desc: "Urgent news from near Kyiv: Russian VDV have landed several assault groups at Hostomel Airport. Our brave National Guard is engaging them, but the situation is highly unstable. If we fail to act swiftly, Russian paratroopers may entrench themselves at the very gates of our capital."
ukr.17.a: "Do everything possible!"

ukr.20.t: "First Round of Talks"
ukr.20.desc: "Talks with Russia have begun in Belarus on conflict resolution and POW exchange. We have lost some territory and may be forced to accept the Russian side’s terms, yet NATO promises new equipment and hardware. What should we do?"
ukr.20.a: "Break off the talks—we will not enter dialogue with them"
ukr.20.b: "Hold our line"

ukr.21.t: "First Round Concluded"
ukr.21.desc: "The first stage of negotiations in Gomel has ended. The Russian side accepted some of our demands. Does this mean Russia faces logistical problems—or is something else at play? No point guessing: the important thing is there is progress toward a cease-fire and peace between our countries."
ukr.21.a: "Excellent"

ukr.24.t: "Second Round of Talks"
ukr.24.desc: "Today the second round of negotiations between our delegation and Russia began in Belovezh Forest. Russia refuses to yield and offers its own plan for settling the conflict. The terms seem impossible for us, yet we are suffering heavy economic and military losses. Perhaps we should make some concessions?"
ukr.24.a: "Better to concede something"
ukr.24.b: "We will not meet their terms"

ukr.25.t: "Second Round Concluded"
ukr.25.desc: "The second round of talks in Belovezh Forest has concluded. Our delegations agreed to begin POW exchanges soon and to open humanitarian corridors. Although a full settlement still seems impossible, hope for a cease-fire remains."
ukr.25.a: "Will the war end peacefully?"

ukr.27.t: "Russian Air Assault near Kherson!"
ukr.27.desc: "Reports confirm a Russian landing near the Antonivka Bridge and the Kakhovka HPP. This darkens the situation in the south: if our troops fall back, we will be unable to blow the bridge, allowing Russian forces to cross the Dnipro swiftly. Ad-hoc territorial-defence units have been formed in nearby towns. Our fighters will stand to the last—glory to Ukraine!"
ukr.27.a: "Heroiam slava!"

ukr.43.t: "Risk of Transnistria Entering the War"
ukr.43.desc: "On the territory of the self-proclaimed PMR, Russia has placed its divisions on alert and ramped up propaganda. Terrorists are likely preparing to attack us from Transnistria; we must strengthen the border and stay vigilant."
ukr.43.a: "We must be extra cautious"

ukr.45.t: "Retreat to Azovstal"
ukr.45.desc: "Sadly, our forces in Mariupol have been overpowered by superior Russian troops and forced to withdraw. Not everyone managed to leave the city. The local garrison and Azov Battalion refused to surrender and took shelter at the Azovstal steelworks, continuing to resist the Kremlin invaders. As true sons of Ukraine, they chose to defend their land to the last. No one knows how long they can hold out in the plant’s basements, surrounded and without food or water, but their heroism will inspire our army and people to keep resisting Putin’s fascist regime. Glory to Ukraine!"
ukr.45.a: "Glory to the heroes of Azovstal!"

ukr.49.t: "Russian Marines Land near Berdiansk"
ukr.49.desc: "A landing of Russian naval infantry has been reported near Berdiansk, close to the villages of Azov and Kulykivske. We lack precise data on numbers and equipment, which is worrying. In Berdiansk a territorial-defence detachment has been hastily formed."
ukr.49.u: "Ukraine will neither die nor yield!"

ukr.51.t: "Russian Airborne Troops South of Kyiv!"
ukr.51.desc: "We have just received word of a Russian landing at the military airfield near Vasylkiv. The invaders are reportedly engaged in heavy fighting with the local air-defence battery. Territorial-defence battalions are being raised in nearby settlements."
ukr.51.u: "Moskali shall not pass!"

ukr.52.t: "Peace Treaty with Russia"
ukr.52.desc: "In the course of our counter-offensive Russian troops were pushed back behind the 1991 borders. Donbas and Crimea were liberated by the AFU and are now fully under Ukrainian control. We took the leading seat at the negotiating table and demanded a cease-fire and recognition of our 1991 borders—Russia agreed. All Ukraine rejoices in victory and the long-awaited peace, while the Russian Z-public goes mad, calling for Putin’s and the government’s resignation."
ukr.52.u: "Peremoha!"

ukr.53.t: "Sinking of the Cruiser *Moskva*"
ukr.53.desc: "The Russian cruiser *Moskva* has sunk after a brilliantly planned operation by our Armed Forces. The ship had been blockading our ports until we struck it with two Neptune missiles. The crew fought desperately to save the pride of Russia’s navy but, luckily, all efforts were in vain: the rusty tub could not withstand our missiles and went down almost at once, dragging to the bottom the Z-mob’s hopes of a quick defeat of the *Nezalezhna*. Though Russia’s MoD claims one fatality, we are sure casualties are far higher."
ukr.53.u: "Russian warship, go fuck yourself!"

ukr.54.t: "President Zelenskyy’s Address"
ukr.54.desc: "“Dear citizens of Ukraine, early this morning President Putin announced the launch of a special military operation in Donbas. Russia has struck our military infrastructure and border guards. Explosions have been heard in many cities. We are introducing martial law across the country. A minute ago I spoke with President Biden—the U.S. is already preparing international support. Today each of you needs calm; if possible, stay at home. We are working, the army is working, Ukraine’s entire security and defence sector is working. I will remain in constant contact with you—the NSDC, the Cabinet. I will soon address you again. No panic—we are strong, ready for anything, we will prevail, because we are Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!”"
ukr.54.u: "Heroiam slava! We will win!"

ukr.55.t: "Tension on the Border"
ukr.55.desc: "The situation on our border with Russia remains extremely tense. GUR provides the MoD with ever more evidence of Russian columns marked ‘Z’ and ‘V,’ while shelling of our positions has increased along the contact line with the LDNR. A video has just appeared online, apparently from the Kalanchak checkpoint: a Ukrainian border guard and several civilians flee advancing Russian armour before the clip cuts off. Meanwhile our border service has lost contact with most checkpoints on the Russian frontier."
ukr.55.u: "Is this the start?"

ukr.56.t: "Zelenskyy’s New-Year Message"
ukr.56.desc: "“The year 2022 wounded us to the heart. We have cried every tear. We have voiced every prayer. Three hundred and eleven days—about each minute we could speak, but most words are superfluous. No explanations, no embellishments. We need silence to hear. We need pauses to understand. We do not know what 2023 will bring. I wish us one thing—victory. That is the main wish for all Ukrainians.\n\nMay the new year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers—back to their families. Prisoners—home. Displaced persons—back to Ukraine. The return of our lands. The temporarily occupied will become forever free.\n\nThe return to ordinary life: to happy moments without curfew, to earthly joys without air-raid sirens. The return of what was stolen from us: our children’s childhood, our parents’ peaceful old age.\n\nMay the new year bring all this. We are ready to fight for it—that is why each of us is here. I am here. We are here. You are here. All of us are Ukraine.\n\nGlory to Ukraine! Happy New Year!”"
ukr.56.u: "2023 will be the year of our victory!"

ukr.57.t: "Zelenskyy’s Briefing"
ukr.57.desc: "“German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said yesterday of Russia’s invasion that Europe has not seen the like for 75 years. True—but not the whole truth. This is not merely an invasion of Ukraine: it is the start of a war against Europe. Against European unity. Against basic human rights on our continent. Against all the rules by which European states refuse to redraw borders by force.\n\nFor the second day our cities suffer missile and bomb strikes. Tank columns and air raids look exactly like those Europe saw during World War II—about which we said ‘never again.’ And yet again has come in 2022, seventy-five years after that war ended. I am sure you see this—all Europe sees it...\n\nAnd finally I address the AFU: stand firm, you are all we have. You are all that defends our state. Glory to Ukraine!”"
ukr.57.u: "The situation is dire, but victory will be ours!"

ukr.58.t: "Zelenskyy Killed"
ukr.58.desc: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been killed in a Russian special-services attack. His motorcade was ambushed by men wearing Territorial-Defence uniforms. Although the assailants were swiftly neutralised, Zelenskyy sustained fatal wounds. Farewell ceremonies were held behind closed doors owing to the risk of further Russian provocations and terror attacks. Spontaneous memorials appear in cities across Ukraine and Europe; Western nations and the UN stand ready to help investigate. The National Security and Defence Council will temporarily assume state leadership."
ukr.58.u: "Rest in peace, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. We will prevail!"

ukr.59.t: "NSDC Convenes"
ukr.59.desc: "Only days remain before a Russian invasion. Nothing can change that now. The latest meeting of the National Security and Defence Council opened under great tension. No one harboured illusions: Ukraine would soon face, on the battlefield, one of the world’s strongest armies. After reports and debate, the council unanimously decided to declare a state of emergency nationwide, with tighter measures along the Russian and Belarusian borders. The regime imposes special entry and exit controls, movement restrictions, vehicle inspections, enhanced public-order security, a ban on strikes, curfew, suspension of some parties, limits on arms sales, and more."
ukr.59.u: "Soon now..."

ukr.60.t: "Medvedchuk Arrested"
ukr.60.desc: "Ukraine’s Security Service has captured Viktor Medvedchuk, leader of one of the country’s biggest opposition parties, who had been in hiding. A pro-Russian politician and Putin’s confidant, he is accused of treason, absconding from house arrest, involvement in Crimea energy projects, passing secret data to Moscow and illegal coal schemes with the DNR/LNR. He fled house arrest as the war began, claiming ‘evacuation.’ He was caught attempting to leave the country dressed as a soldier. The investigation continues."
ukr.60.u: "Found him after all"

ukr.61.t: "Proposal to Swap Medvedchuk"
ukr.61.desc: "Russia has proposed exchanging the detained Viktor Medvedchuk for 250 captured AFU soldiers, including Azov fighters. Medvedchuk could become a dangerous political tool in Russian hands, yet we would recover more prisoners than we relinquish."
ukr.61.u: "The lives of our soldiers are worth more"
ukr.61.a: "Out of the question"

ukr.62.t: "Russians Approach Kyiv"
ukr.62.desc: "Despite our troops’ desperate resistance, Russian forces draw ever closer to the capital. Most Western analysts predict Kyiv’s fall within 48 hours, while the city sinks into panic and chaos. We will not surrender and will hold the capital to the last, so all our strength must be mobilised immediately to prepare for the occupiers’ arrival."
ukr.62.a: "Ukraina ponad use!"

ukr.63.t: "Talks Reach Dead End"
ukr.63.desc: "Throughout negotiations, our delegation has received only ultimatums, vague accusations and demands Ukraine cannot accept. Matters have worsened with evidence of Russian war crimes in occupied areas. Talks are at an impasse; a peace deal is postponed indefinitely."
ukr.63.a: "We’ll tighten our belts..."

ukr.64.t: "High Command Conference"
ukr.64.desc: "While the government still reassures the public there will be no war, the General Staff harbours no illusions. U.S. and NATO intelligence confirmed Russian invasion plans back in December. Scenarios range from another Donbas flare-up to a full assault from all directions. Whatever war Moscow plans, one thing must remain constant—our strategy. Zaluzhnyy and his team insist on mobile warfare, arguing that in Ukraine’s steppes victory over Russia will rest on manoeuvre defence followed by counter-attacks. Old-school generals advocate static defence with strong fortifications to bleed the enemy dry. The meeting nears its end; the final word belongs to the supreme commander-in-chief."
ukr.64.a: "We should adopt Zaluzhnyy’s plan"
ukr.64.b: "Old-school methods still matter"

ukr.65.t: "International Legion of Ukraine’s Territorial Defence"
ukr.65.desc: "From the very start of Russian aggression, the civilised world has supported us. Thousands of foreign volunteers instantly offered to fight in the AFU. The president has therefore decreed the creation of the International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine. This formation will unite volunteer units of foreign specialists and patriots. The first legionnaires are already training at western ranges, ready to defend Ukraine and the free world."
ukr.65.a: "Glory to the internationalist fighters!"

ukr.66.t: "Russian Airborne Forces Land in Kharkiv"
ukr.66.desc: "Russian VDV troops have reportedly landed at Kharkiv Airport and seized it. The city is under siege; the National Guard and local self-defence have been placed on alert."
ukr.66.a: "Ukraina ponad use!"

ukr.67.t: "Russian Airborne Forces Land in Odesa"
ukr.67.desc: "Landing parties of Russian VDV and Navy troops have been reported near Odesa. The city is under siege; the National Guard and local self-defence battalions are on full alert."
ukr.67.a: "The enemy will not pass!"

ukr.68.t: "Russian Airborne Forces Land in Mykolaiv"
ukr.68.desc: "Russian airborne and naval landing groups have reportedly come ashore near Mykolaiv. The city is under siege; the National Guard and local self-defence forces are on full alert."
ukr.68.a: "Glory to the defenders of the Motherland!"

ukr.69.t: "Russian Airborne Forces Land in Zaporizhzhia"
ukr.69.desc: "Russian VDV troops have reportedly landed at DniproHES and the Balka Bridge in Zaporizhzhia. The city is under siege; the National Guard and local self-defence have been placed on alert."
ukr.69.a: "Death to the occupiers!"

ukr.70.t: "Medvedchuk Escapes House Arrest"
ukr.70.desc: "The Prosecutor-General’s Office announced a week ago that Viktor Medvedchuk had fled house arrest, but he was officially declared wanted only today. He is thought to have left his residence days before the Russian aggression and is hiding somewhere in Kyiv Oblast. A special task force of SBU and prosecutors is searching. Since 2021 Medvedchuk faces charges of treason, war-law violations, passing AFU secrets, handing Russia an Azov Sea gas field and subversive recruiting. Yuriy Boyko becomes acting chairman of the OPZZh political council."
ukr.70.a: "Find him at once"

ukr.71.t: "Creation of ‘Platform for Life and Peace’"
ukr.71.desc: "Former deputies of the banned pro-Russian faction Opposition Platform–For Life have formed a new parliamentary group ‘Platform for Life and Peace.’ Chaired by Yuriy Boyko, ex-head of Opposition Bloc and OPZZh political council, the group claims ‘no longer to be opposition but for peace.’ Yet traces of OPZZh Russophilia remain and may threaten Ukraine’s political security."
ukr.71.a: "Parliament must preserve pluralism"

ukr.72.t: "Crowds of Volunteers"
ukr.72.desc: "With war’s outbreak, true sons of our motherland rose to defend it. Within hours hundreds applied to enlist in the AFU. Recruitment centres are bursting with citizens eager to save the country from Russian occupation. National morale is sky-high. We will not yield to Putin; we will fight for every metre of Ukraine."
ukr.72.a: "Rise up, native land!"

ukr.73.t: "Mass Looting"
ukr.73.desc: "Amid Russia’s invasion and widespread gun distribution to volunteers, looting and organised crime have increased in Kyiv and other big cities. Criminals rob shops, fire randomly and form gangs, often posing as territorial-defence fighters. Police have begun patrols and arrests, but stronger measures are needed to curb crime."
ukr.73.a: "We’ll monitor the situation"

ukr.74.t: "We Must Act Immediately"
ukr.74.desc: ""

ukr.74.a: "We must deal with this right now"

ukr.74.t: "Corruption Scandal"
ukr.74.desc: "A major scandal has erupted, exposing large-scale corruption among top officials. NABU and SAP have launched an investigation into government procurement fraud. Officials leverage political and financial ties, seeking to halt the probe through threats and bribes, and have leaked disinformation to smear NABU and SAP. The public demands action; consequences may include tougher laws and dismissals."
ukr.74.a: "The guilty must be punished at once"

ukr.75.t: "Quota-Gate Corruption"
ukr.75.desc: "A scandal flares over exit permits amid war and mobilisation. Travel abroad has become vital for many, but the process is now tainted by corruption: officials and intermediaries demand bribes for exit quotas. Citizens may be denied safe departure. The abuse undermines trust and threatens national security. The public calls for an immediate probe and harsh penalties. Corruption in wartime exit quotas is intolerable and must be stamped out."
ukr.75.a: "We must act more cautiously"

ukr.76.t: "Political Scandal over Repression Claims"
ukr.76.desc: "A new scandal erupts as authorities stand accused of minor yet visible repression of political opponents. The episode sparks public and international criticism. The opposition exploits it to boost support. Henceforth we must tread carefully to prevent such incidents."
ukr.76.a: "It was necessary"

ukr.77.t: "Opposition Eliminated"
ukr.77.desc: "Leaders of three major political parties—Petro Symonenko (CPU), Oleh Tyahnybok (Svoboda) and Yuriy Boyko (PZHM)—were unexpectedly arrested today. No formal charges yet; details remain unclear. The arrests cause unrest at home and abroad; analysts fear for democracy and human rights. The public demands transparency and investigation. Citizens are urged to remain calm and follow developments closely."
ukr.77.a: "This was necessary"

ukr.94.t: "Generals Agree!"
ukr.94.desc: "After lengthy negotiations the old officer corps has agreed to assist."
ukr.94.a: "Great news!"

ukr.95.t: "Generals Refuse!"
ukr.95.desc: "After lengthy negotiations the old officer corps refused to assist."
ukr.95.a: "Disappointing"

ukr.98.t: "Russia Issues an Ultimatum"
ukr.98.desc: "After defeats on several fronts, the Russian government has, via intermediaries, presented us a draft peace treaty to end the conflict. Key terms include:\n • Immediate cease-fire\n • Withdrawal of forces from the Donetsk and Luhansk Republics\n • Disarmament of National Guard battalions\n • Granting Russia a land corridor to Crimea\n • Renunciation of NATO aspirations and guarantees of neutrality\n • Zelenskyy’s resignation and early elections.\n\nThe terms appear unacceptable, yet they may be our only chance to preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty. The decision rests with the Commander-in-Chief."
ukr.98.a: "For Ukraine’s future..."

ukr.96.t: "The Kolomoiskyi Case"
ukr.96.desc: "Back in March 2021 the U.S. State Department sanctioned Ihor Kolomoiskyi for corruption. Until today we had levelled no charges. Now, after searches, schemes siphoning 40 billion hryvnias from Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta are clear. The SBU reminds us that Ukrnafta is the country’s largest oil producer and Ukrtatnafta its biggest refiner. Ten criminal episodes are being documented. Kolomoiskyi, stripped of Ukrainian citizenship and holding Israeli and Cypriot passports, is suspected of embezzling 9.2 billion from PrivatBank. His assets are under temporary seizure; Kyiv’s Shevchenko Court has remanded him for 60 days with bail set at 509 million hryvnias. The investigation continues..."

ukr.97.t: "The Motor Sich Case"
ukr.97.desc: "SBU searches were conducted at Zaporizhzhia’s Motor Sich: president Viacheslav Bohuslaiev is suspected of state treason—collaboration and aiding the aggressor. He faces life imprisonment. According to the SBU, illegal deliveries of military goods for Russian strike aviation were organised with Rostec. Products were used to build and repair attack helicopters employed against Ukraine. Bohuslaiev was detained and brought to Kyiv after security forces forced entry to his home. He is also known for a 2016 donation to a statue at Russia’s Valaam Monastery, frequently visited by Putin."

What reserves do we have?\n\nEnergy Minister Herman Halushchenko coughs, eyes his papers: \n\n— Main distribution systems... they’re wrecked. We’re running on scraps, and frankly, it’s not enough to power the whole country.\n\nState Emergency Service head Serhii Kruk exhales: \n\n— Fires, damage, patching this damned network... our crews are at breaking point. Each strike wipes us out. We have no prep time left, we’re out of tricks.\n\nSilence hangs heavy. Shmyhal scans the room, then speaks: \n\n— Without allied support we’re...

I believe that matters,” he said. Macron stressed diplomacy and the inviolability of the Minsk agreements, noting both sides still declare readiness to fulfil them."

ukr.102.t: "Field-Modified Bradley"
ukr.102.desc: "Reports from the front say our field mechanics, after new deliveries of IFVs, have upgraded the Bradley: fitting a Drozd APS, new blow-off panels and additional spall liner. The variant has been jokingly nicknamed the ‘Krypak’, apparently for the vehicle’s enhanced protection. Experts note, however, that large-scale conversion to this standard is impossible."

ukr.777.t: "The Unbreakable Leader"
ukr.777.d: "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again proved his resolve in the face of modern challenges. Despite pressure and hardship, his leadership remains a symbol of unity and resilience.\nToday everyone must realise that attempts to undermine him weaken not the man but the system built on devotion, faith and determination. Zelenskyy is more than a politician—he embodies the struggle for freedom, independence and progress.\nSupporting his course means supporting a future where the nation stays united. Enemies may try to wreck plans, but history shows strong leaders live on in the memory of generations, and their ideas endure."

ukr.781.t: "Arestovych Lashes Out at Us!"
ukr.781.d: "In his latest stream Oleksiy Arestovych spoke extremely negatively about our government, using obscene language such as ‘Zele-macher’, ‘Green Führer’, ‘Dwarf’, ‘Bastard’, ‘F***ing bitch’, ‘Pitiful dictator’. Such behaviour is unacceptable for a public figure of his popularity."

ukr.782.t: "Manpower Crisis"
ukr.782.d: "The front is exhausted, combat units lose effectiveness and reinforcements arrive ever more rarely. Generals sound the alarm—personnel shortages mount while the enemy gains strength.\nGovernment faces a hard choice: lower the mobilisation age.\n• 18 years: the nation’s future sent to the trenches—raw recruits may cost us victory.\n• 19–20 years: young and strong but still forming—will ease shortages yet anger families.\n• 20–22 years: more mature, better prepared, but won’t fully solve the deficit."

Calling themselves opponents of Putin’s regime, they are ready to take up arms—this time against their former comrades.\nThey say propaganda lied to them; they’ve seen the war’s true face and will no longer serve a criminal power.

ukr.787.d: "The first face-to-face between Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyy and Andriy Biletskyi was constructive and warm. They agreed to expand volunteer formations within the Defence Forces: new brigades will train cadre, build territorial defence and raise readiness. Decisions approved, coordination begun."
ukr.787.a: "Excellent"

ukr.788.t: "Zaluzhnyy–Biletskyi Meeting Tense"
ukr.788.d: "The meeting proved notably tenser. Sources report disagreements over numbers, structure and command. Biletskyi’s team wanted broad expansion, while the General Staff worried about control and logistics. A compromise allows a few battalions—support remains, but scale is smaller."
ukr.788.a: "Tolerable"

ukr.789.t: "Zaluzhnyy Refuses!"
ukr.789.d: "Talks between Zaluzhnyy and Biletskyi collapsed. They failed to agree on strength or command chains; the General Staff feared autonomy risks, Biletskyi’s side voiced distrust. New brigades cancelled; project frozen indefinitely."
ukr.789.a: "Bad"

ukr.790.t: "Syrskyi Warns of Arms Shortage"
ukr.790.d: "At a closed General Staff meeting weeks before the open invasion, Ground-Forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi and others warned of systemic shortages of weapons and ammunition. At current supply most brigades could fight only a few days; ATGMs, air-defence and artillery shells were especially scarce. The report was sent to top leadership; response was muted."
ukr.790.a: "Conduct an audit"

ukr.791.t: "Shell Situation Worse Than Expected"
ukr.791.d: "An internal check of MoD hubs and depots shows real artillery stocks far below estimates. Some brigades are only partially supplied; on some fronts there is no basic reserve. Experts cite reporting failures, old inventory data and logistics issues. General Staff calls the situation ‘difficult but under control’ and orders an urgent audit."
ukr.791.a: "Bad"

ukr.792.t: "Shell Crisis"
ukr.792.d: "A report to the highest level confirms the worst: ammunition supplies are critical. Stockpiles are minimal; some sectors are effectively disarmed. Deliveries lag, domestic output falls behind schedule, and foreign contracts are stalled by bureaucracy and politics. A senior officer bluntly said: ‘If it kicks off tomorrow—we’ll have nothing to shoot.’ Emergency measures have yet to bear fruit."
ukr.792.a: "Very bad"
ukr.793.t: "Better Than We Feared"
ukr.793.d: "A thorough inventory and repeat review of reserve depots revealed that part of our ammunition stock had never been entered in the reports. A sizeable share of deliveries since mid-last year was sitting at intermediate bases and had not been logged in the system. Moreover, several supply contracts are already being fulfilled. The General Staff states that the situation is far from ideal but ‘much more stable than it seemed’. For the first time in months—good news."
ukr.793.a: "Excellent"

ukr.794.t: "Monastyrskyi Killed"
ukr.794.d: "Today it became known that Ukraine’s Minister of the Interior, Denys Monastyrskyi, has died. According to preliminary information the tragedy occurred in an air-crash; details are being clarified. The country’s leadership expressed condolences to his family and friends. Monastyrskyi had headed the Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2021."
ukr.794.a: "A great loss..."

ukr.795.t: "Oligarchs Agree"
ukr.795.d: "Amid disturbing news from border regions and rising international tension, Ukrainian oligarchs met with government representatives. For the first time in a long while they voiced a united position: they will provide financial assistance to the country. Participants agreed to coordinate efforts, support the defence and energy sectors, and refrain from meddling in politics. ‘Now is no time for internal games. Now is the time to unite,’ the final statement declared."
ukr.795.a: "At last, some good news"

ukr.796.t: "Oligarchs Will Help—For a Price?"
ukr.796.d: "The meeting with big-business representatives took place against a backdrop of mounting instability. The oligarchs confirmed readiness to help—but with a caveat: anti-corruption reforms are off the table for now. ‘We’re not against change, just not when everything might blow up. The main thing now is to keep control,’ said one participant. Thus assistance is offered in exchange for a ‘temporary lull’ on issues of oversight and transparency."
ukr.796.a: "Questionable, but okay"

ukr.797.t: "Oligarchs Refuse"
ukr.797.d: "This time an agreement proved impossible. Major business groups declined to join state support programmes, citing distrust of the management system and fears for their safety and assets. ‘We see no clear rules, guarantees, accountability,’ said their representatives. The government is left without the resources it had counted on. The situation keeps evolving—and it seems everyone now thinks only of himself."
ukr.797.a: "Fine"

ukr.798.t: "Poroshenko Returns to Kyiv"
ukr.798.d: "On 17 January 2022 Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, arrived in Kyiv to attend a court hearing on possible treason charges. He was not detained at the airport and went straight to the Pechersk Court. His return caused a stir in political circles and was accompanied by supporters outside the courthouse. The court imposed a personal recognisance bond. Poroshenko called the case politically motivated."
ukr.798.a: "Is democracy dead?"

ukr.799.t: "Launch of the Sich Satellite"
ukr.799.d: "On 13 January 2022 a SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully lifted the Ukrainian Earth-observation satellite ‘Sich-2-30’ into orbit—the first Ukrainian satellite launch in ten years. The project was carried out under the state space programme. The satellite will monitor natural resources, ecology, emergencies and defence needs."
ukr.799.a: "Awesome"

ukr.800.t: "Shake-up in the General Staff"
ukr.800.d: "Personnel changes have been announced at the highest level of military command. Officers already dubbed the ideal pair for troubled times become the new chief of staff and his first deputy. Both have frontline experience, solid reputations and troop support. Insiders note ‘complete mutual understanding and a common goal’ between them. The tandem is expected to speed up reforms and boost combat readiness."
ukr.800.a: "Zaluzhnyy, Zaluzhnyy and again Zaluzhnyy!"
ukr.800.b: "Syrskyi has proved himself very well"
ukr.800.c: "Perhaps Biletskyi?"
ukr.800.d: "More options"

ukr.801.t: "Alternative Appointments"
ukr.801.desc: "The reshuffle in the General Staff has drawn criticism within the army hierarchy. The new duo is seen as weak and unbalanced, lacking trust from part of the command. Officers note that those appointed have not shown themselves in crises and lack authority. ‘Not the kind you lean on in hard times,’ said one source. The decision is already called political and ill-timed."
ukr.801.a: "Prokopenko?"
ukr.801.d: "Drapatyi?"   

ukr.802.t: "On What Basis to Found Our PMC?"
ukr.802.d: "Sources close to the defence leadership say the General Staff is weighing two options for creating private military companies. First: build PMCs from Special-Operations Forces veterans; second: adapt certain regular brigades to work autonomously. No decision yet, but debate is lively. Key factors will be trust, controllability and potential effectiveness in critical sectors."
ukr.802.a: "Use the SOF as a base!"
ukr.802.b: "Use regular units as a base!"

ukr.803.t: "PMC Based on SOF"
ukr.803.d: "After discussion the General Staff chose the Special-Operations Forces as the core for experimental PMC structures. Official confirmation is pending, but sources say SOF troops showed the autonomy, discipline and effectiveness required for high-intensity combat. Pilot units are already forming. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity."
ukr.803.a: "Experienced but few"

ukr.804.t: "PMC Based on Regular Units"
ukr.804.d: "Contrary to initial expectations the General Staff opted to form PMCs from regular-army brigades. Argument: scale, manpower pool and existing logistics. Critics fear weaker control and discipline, yet supporters say ‘it’s easier to scale and introduce flexible formats’. Pilot units are being prepared in limited numbers."
ukr.804.a: "Inexperienced but many"

ukr.107.t: "Faryon Killed"
ukr.107.desc: "Near her home in Lviv 60-year-old linguist and former Svoboda MP Iryna Faryon was fatally wounded; she died in intensive care four hours later. Investigators treat it as a political murder. At the scene a spent 9×18 mm sporting round was found—a rare cartridge favored by hobby shooters."

Five hours later police arrested a 46-year-old AFU deserter. Investigators classify the case as a contract political killing and are probing a ‘Russian trace’."

Forty-five-year-old Lyudmyla Chymerska fired several Makarov shots; one round passed through Sternenko’s thigh without hitting vital organs. His guard subdued the attacker; the SBU detained her on the spot."

Ukraine is already scaling output, but we need not tens of thousands—millions. One million shells a year is the ambitious target. Can resources, capacity and staff meet it? The future depends not only on allies but on our own assembly lines."
ukr_hidden.4.a: "We’ll do it!"

ukr_hidden.5.t: "Goal Met—and Surpassed!"
ukr_hidden.5.d: "We set an ambitious goal and met it: over 1 000 000 shells produced in a year. This is the result of engineers, workers and logisticians working round-the-clock. Production continues—this is only the beginning."
ukr_hidden.5.a: "Let’s drink to that!"

ukr_hidden.6.t: "Did We Succeed?"
ukr_hidden.6.d: "We hit a million shells—yes. Lines never stopped, shifts ran without breaks. But now reports show dispersion issues, trajectory instability and fitting flaws. We’ll keep refining and tightening QC. A million is power; an accurate million is victory."
ukr_hidden.6.a: "This is a fiasco..."

ukr_hidden.7.t: "Bad News from the Front"
ukr_hidden.7.d: "We boasted of a million shells, yet footage shows duds, wild shots or barrels bursting. Commanders cite unstable batches. Production continues, but lessons will be learned: quantity matters, yet quality wins."
ukr_hidden.7.a: "Hmm..."

ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.t: "Operation ‘Spiderweb’"
ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.d: "Leaks reveal drone strikes on Russian airfields. Unclear whether the attack on the Crimean Bridge and strikes in Bryansk and Moscow regions are part of ‘Spiderweb’, but by day’s end: a damaged bridge pier and a new Kronstadt UAV plant hit. Airbases Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya were all struck, with at least 12 VKS aircraft damaged—7 Tu-95, 4 Tu-22, 1 An-12 (CSIS confirms 14; AFU GS claims 41). Drones were hidden in container roofs and launched from civilian trucks.\nRussia cannot quickly replace long-range bombers. Experts foresee ‘retaliatory strikes’, but for now we await further news."
ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.a: "A daring raid"
ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.b: "Holy hell."

ukr_big_cleaning.1.t: "Poroshenko’s Fate"
ukr_big_cleaning.1.d: "President Zelenskyy faces a tough choice concerning Petro Poroshenko. Investigations are intensifying and two scenarios emerge:\n• ‘Honourable Exile’—Poroshenko leaves Ukraine in exchange for charges being dropped, avoiding internal conflict but weakening Zelenskyy before the opposition.\n• ‘Trial and Punishment’—proceed with prosecution, arrest Poroshenko and show that no one is above the law, strengthening Zelenskyy’s base but angering the West and raising instability."
ukr_big_cleaning.1.a: "Prison!"
ukr_big_cleaning.1.b: "Offer him a... trip abroad"

ukr_big_cleaning.2.t: "Tymoshenko’s Fate"
ukr_big_cleaning.2.d: "Yuliya Tymoshenko remains powerful. Two options:\n• ‘Political Exile’—let her leave the country, easing tension but fuelling accusations of authoritarianism.\n• ‘Arrest and Trial’—prosecute her for corruption, signalling resolve but risking backlash from her supporters."
ukr_big_cleaning.2.a: "Yulia and jail are synonyms!"
ukr_big_cleaning.2.b: "Perhaps let her depart?"

ukr.108.t: "Trial of ‘Redut’ Mercenaries"
ukr.108.desc: "After a brief fight on the front line, an entire detachment of Russian ‘Redut’ mercenaries was surrounded and captured. Phone footage proved their involvement in torture of civilians. They were brought to [UKR.capital.GetName] and given 11-year sentences for war crimes.\n\nThe prosecutor noted: ‘This is Ukraine’s first conviction of PMC/GU GRU personnel.’ The process publicly exposed the RF unit dubbed in media as the ‘General-Staff pseudo-PMC Redut’."
ukr.108.u: "Interesting"
