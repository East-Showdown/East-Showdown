WGN_mission.1.d: "The goal facing us in terms of capturing the city of Bakhmut, at first glance, may seem cruel and inhumane: to crush as many Ukrainian troops as possible in this city. However, behind this goal lies strategic logic and an understanding of the importance of offensive operations in the context of a military conflict.\nThe city of Soledar will be the starting point.\nThe capture of the city of Soledar plays an important role in the strategy of encircling enemy troops in the city of Bakhmut. This is a key step that can ensure the successful implementation of the surrounding operation and give an advantage on the battlefield. That is why the capture Soledara is so important."

We inflicted significant damage on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but, unfortunately, were unable to achieve all the objectives of the operation. The Ukrainians concentrated under Bakhmut had huge forces, including tanks, special forces and artillery, so we had practically no opportunity to defeat Bandera’s followers. Evgeniy Viktorovich spoke about this in his press service and accused the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces of not providing adequate support to the group 'Wagner', which led to the failure of the Bakhmut Meat Grinder operation. This was a big blow to our reputation, but we continue to be the most combat-ready unit in the Northern Military District zone. We still have everything ahead."

rus.156.t: "Failure of armored column tactics"
rus.156.desc: "From the very beginning of the Special Military Operation, the whole world saw images of slender columns of Russian armored vehicles with marks Z and V crossing Ukrainian border checkpoints without any resistance. Hour after hour, commanders of armored columns reported on the capture of more and more settlements , going deeper into enemy territory. It seemed that columns of armored vehicles would occupy the main cities of Ukraine without a single shot within just a few days. But in the end, all this turned out to be just an illusion. Receiving repulse from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our equipment fell into a jam and was one by one destroyed, unable to retreat in an orderly manner. One of the main tactics of the special operation in Ukraine, chosen by the General Staff, completely failed."

All targets operations "Mongoose Throw" were carried out. Zelensky's Nazi regime is no longer able to hold the front and will inevitably fall in the near future. From this position, we are sending an ultimatum to the government of Ukraine demanding surrender. We count on their voluntary surrender and submission to our demands, but in case of refusal We will finish what we started and finish off the Bandera bastard."

rus.158.desc: "No matter how successful the offensive in Ukraine was in the first days of the Special Military Operation, a month later all the shortcomings of army management and organization in the ranks of our troops were revealed. During the month of fighting, our soldiers failed to achieve all their goals, which actually means the failure of Operation Mongoose Throw and the disruption of the plans of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. Now the only correct decisions remain a total revision of our military doctrine, large-scale personnel changes and preparation for a long, protracted war..."

rus.182.desc: "It is necessary to resolve the issue of the composition of the interim government of Ukraine. Among the proposed options for the position of acting president, four main candidates can be highlighted:\n\nV.V. Medvedchuk - a state, public, and political figure of Ukraine. One of the founders of the pro-Russian party OPZZh. A figure close to Putin and the Russian authorities. Currently, the head of the interim military-civil administration of Kyiv. The most acceptable option.\n\nY.A. Boyko - a Ukrainian state and political figure. Member of OPZZh and Medvedchuk's right-hand man. In 2014, during negotiations with Ukraine, he was proposed by us for the position of head of the Luhansk region. He pursues a more moderate domestic policy, considering the interests of both Russia and the Ukrainian people.\n\nV.F. Yanukovych - former Ukrainian president, illegally overthrown as a result of the 2014 coup and fled to the Russian Federation. He pursued a balanced policy with a clear pro-Russian bias. He is the most legitimate candidate but extremely unpopular among the Ukrainian people.\n\nI.V. Kiva - former People's Deputy from OPZZh, member of the Committee on Legislative Support of Law Enforcement Activities. On the eve of the Special Operation, he left for Russia through Spain. He has an unpleasant past associated with the "Right Sector" and participation in hostilities in eastern Ukraine as part of the "Poltava" national battalion. He is radically opposed to the former Ukrainian junta. He has repeatedly spoken in support of President Putin's policy and the "merger" of Ukraine and Russia."

The confederation project "Union of People's Republics - Novorossiya" was adopted on May 24, 2014, resulting in the formation of the SNP Council, which included three representatives from both sides. On June 24-25, the Supreme Councils of the DPR and LPR delegated 30 deputies each to the future SNP parliament, and DPR Prime Minister Alexander Borodai announced that the union state would have its own constitution. However, the Second Minsk Agreements did not provide for the implementation of Novorossiya, due to which the project was frozen.\n\nNow, after the fall of the Kyiv regime, the possibility of implementing the confederation is again on everyone's lips. The heads of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics propose reviving the project, including all historical territories of Novorossiya liberated during the Special Operation in the new state. An equally popular proposal is to include these territories in the Russian Federation as new subjects. But one thing is clear - the future of eastern Ukraine is only with Russia."

The new Ukrainian government did not hide its radical views and nationalist aspirations, which caused serious concern among the Russian-speaking population of the East of the country.\n\nIn the spring of that year, mass protests against the Kiev regime and its anti-Russian policy began in Luhansk. And a little later, in response to the brutal retaliatory actions by Ukrainian nationalists, the Luhansk People's Republic was proclaimed. The people of Luhansk stood up to defend themselves and their land.\n\nThe Luhansk Republic, along with Donetsk, became a symbol of the revival of the Russian world. An honest and open referendum was held in the Republic, in which the overwhelming majority of residents voted for independence from Ukraine. But Kiev nationalists, encouraged by their Western masters, unleashed a war against the peaceful population of Donbass, wishing to eradicate the Russian people and culture.\n\nDespite the offensive actions by the Ukrainian Army militants, the LPR militias managed to hold the defense and protect their native cities from the Banderite bloodsuckers. After the Minsk agreements were concluded, the situation in the Republic began to slowly stabilize. For 8 years now, we have been trying to achieve recognition from the international community to finally stop the genocide of the Russian-speaking population carried out by the Kiev junta regime. Nevertheless, right now the situation is again becoming extremely tense. Just one spark is needed for the conflict to flare up with renewed force.

WGN.2.t: "Doubtful deliveries"
WGN.2.d: "After our resounding successes at the front and the increase in the number of PMCs, for some unknown reason, the amount of ammunition supplied from the Ministry of Defense began to decline enormously. We are not clear about their motives and what they want to achieve with this, but one thing is clear - a shortage of supplies in huge quantities times our losses will increase. If they wanted to go into direct conflict, then we can definitely count on the public support that we received when we began participating in the war."
WGN.2.a: "Let's see what happens next."
WGN.3.t: "Appeal to Putin"
WGN.3.d: "After the start of the artificial shell famine, we tried to resolve the conflict with the Ministry of Defense in many ways, but it is obvious that they do not want to resolve the conflict and will continue to starve PMCs. In this regard, we turn to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin with a request to resolve the current chaos in the Ministry of Defense and put pressure on those who refuse to supply us with the required amount of weapons. Russian blood must stop being shed because of the bureaucrats who have stayed too long in the military command."

After fulfilling our conditions, we return to the NWO zone."

WGN.6.d: "We have received Vladimir Putin’s refusal to fulfill our conditions.

WGN.10.d: "PMC "Wagner" is one of the best and strongest private military groups in the world, and its influence extends to many countries in Africa and the Middle East. Wagner includes fighters who are time-tested, tempered in spirit and led by experienced commanders. Many PMCs of the world can envy "Wagner". But the war with Ukraine is approaching, and we will probably have to face the Kyiv regime, fighting on the side of our homeland - Russia. We must start preparing."

WGN.11.t: ""The oligarchs needed the war...""
WGN.11.d: "Evgeny Prigozhin gave a long interview in which he spoke about the origins of the war and the first days of the Russian Armed Forces’ offensive against Ukraine. In the video, he stated that most statements by the Russian Ministry of Defense are just window dressing, and pointed out that everything that happens in Ukraine is for the benefit not of the state itself, but of the oligarchs who have long been entrenched in the government. Prigozhin also noted that for these monsters the life of an ordinary soldier is cheaper than shells, and Shoigu deceived the president and started a war only in order to get marshal and one star with additional embroidery. The interview quickly became popular and spread across the Internet, raising certain questions among the public about the Ministry of Defense and our government."
WGN.11.a: "Donbass has been plundered since 2014!"
WGN.12.t: "The Russian Armed Forces are mining our rear areas"
WGN.12.d: "Quite recently, our sappers discovered explosives planted in the rear areas along the routes of units of the Wagner PMC. Initially, we assumed that this was the activity of the DRG of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but after a thorough investigation we came to the conclusion that the mining of this area was the work of units of the RF Armed Forces. In addition, yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel of the RF Armed Forces Vinivitin opened fire on a vehicle of the Wagner PMC, justifying this with his "personal enmity." Evidence of these egregious actions was published by Evgeney Viktorovich and is spreading across the Internet with incredible speed. Recently "Such cases are happening more and more. The Ministry of Defense is becoming more and more sophisticated in its attempts to weaken and destroy the "Musicians". Something needs to be done about it."
WGN.12.a: "They will answer for everything!"
WGN.13.t: ""Shoigu's son-in-law walks around shaking his buns, but ordinary people bring their children in zinc...""
WGN.13.d: "Evgeny Prigozhin gave an interview again, this time to Konstantin Dolgov, a journalist for the Telega Online stream show. The hour-long video discussed problems with training, equipment and organization in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Prigozhin also noted that Russia can only now, as a result of the "Lessons of War" in Ukraine, be called a combat-ready country, and then with a stretch. Also, the head of the Wagner PMC spoke about Shoigu and his son-in-law Stolyarov, who now lives in Dubai. Sharp statements by Prigozhin once again "raised a fuss on the Internet, dividing Russian patriots into two camps. But in any case, everyone still understands that the truth is on our side, and as long as such creatures as Shoigu and Gerasimov sit in the top military leadership of Russia, we will not win."
WGN.13.a: "Shoigu to hell!"
WGN.14.t: "PMC "Wagner" orphaned"
WGN.14.d: "Horrifying news came from the Tver region - the personal plane of the head of our PMC crashed over Kuzhenkin. According to Rosaviatsiya, the main figures of Wagner, Evgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, were on board. Their inner circle reports that they can get through and contact it is impossible for them. Despite the fact that the bodies have not yet been identified, we can already say with confidence that, to our deepest regret, Dima and Zhenya died. It is absolutely obvious who organized the murder of the main patriots of our Motherland. It was the greatest mistake to come to an agreement with the Russian political leadership , and this mistake cost us our greatest commanders, without whom Wagner would be beheaded. These bald rats could not be trusted! "
WGN.14.a: "Is this... the end?"
WGN.15.t: ""Shoigu, Gerasimov, where the fuck is the ammunition?""
WGN.15.d: "After many appeals to the Ministry of Defense regarding ammunition and shell starvation, we received absolutely no response. We were simply ignored. Meanwhile, the war continues. Today, after an unsuccessful assault, a group of our mercenaries suffered significant losses, which can be it was possible to reduce it by 5 or even more times if we had been given the ammunition quota. Prigozhin, who had to see with his own eyes the mountain of 200 Wagners, flew into a rage and decided to express himself emotionally by filming it. The video instantly spread throughout the Internet , causing mixed reactions from all parties to the conflict."
WGN.15.a: ""They came here as volunteers and are dying for you to fatten!""
WGN.16.t: "Results of the Council of Commanders of the PMC "Wagner""
WGN.16.d: "There are no special instructions for the death of two leaders at once in our company, so the further fate of the entire PMC and the new leader should be chosen through a general meeting of the council of commanders. [WGN_council_commanders_event_AT] Instead, the council of commanders can remain the main governing body of "Wagner", which will allow jointly during the meetings to solve the issues of our activities. But many agreed that the decapitated "Musicians" will never recover from such a blow as the death of Prigozhin and Utkin, and therefore it is better to stop the PMC's activities. So, according to the results of the council..."
WGN_council_commanders_event_AT_1: "On the one hand, at the moment, the highest in rank and the only cronies of Prigozhin, who remained after his death, are the head of combat and training work Anton Elizarov, as well as Chief of Staff and head of the Security Service Andrei Troshev.

WGN.17.d: "This evening a missile strike was carried out on our field camp. Our comrades in arms, with whom we forged victory for our Motherland, were killed. The blow was not dealt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as we might have initially thought, but by snickering scum from our Ministry of Defense. Shoigu has already gone crazy, openly killing the "Musicians," while our Supreme Commander-in-Chief hammers home the point and doesn’t even try to fight it. We fought shoulder to shoulder with these creatures, defending the honor of Russia, and they hit us in the back like vile rats. We are not going to tolerate this kind of treatment anymore."

However, we have now conducted searches, revealing schemes for embezzling 40 billion hryvnias from the companies 'Ukrnafta' and 'Ukrtatnafta'. The SBU reminds us that PJSC 'Ukrnafta' is Ukraine's largest oil production company, and PJSC 'Ukrtatnafta' is the largest oil refinery. Currently, 10 episodes of criminal activity are being documented within the criminal case. The case materials mention Kolomoisky as a person deprived of Ukrainian citizenship and a citizen of Israel and Cyprus. Additionally, the SAP and NABU have informed Kolomoisky of the suspicion; he is suspected of embezzling 9.2 billion hryvnias from PrivatBank as the former ultimate beneficiary. The actions of all revealed individuals are qualified as crimes under Articles 191, 209, 366 of the Criminal Code, depending on each person's role in the criminal scheme. Similarly, NABU temporarily seized Kolomoisky's assets, as known from a decision by the Kyiv Court of Appeal. The Shevchenko District Court of Kyiv sent businessman Ihor Kolomoisky into custody for 60 days, with the possibility of posting bail in the amount of 509 million hryvnias.

According to the SBU, the arrest occurred as part of a criminal proceeding regarding the illegal supply of military goods by 'Motor Sich' for Russian assault aviation. 'According to the investigation materials, the plant's management in Zaporizhzhia was involved in the deal. The officials conspired with representatives of the Russian corporation 'Rostec,' which is one of the main producers of weapons for the Russian Armed Forces,' the SBU reported. The occupiers used the received products for the production and repair of Russian attack helicopters, which they have used extensively for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the Zaporizhzhia city portal 'ZaBor,' Boguslaev's home was searched, with law enforcement having to break down doors as Boguslaev's family refused to open them. The businessman was detained and taken under escort to Kyiv. The head of 'Motor Sich' is also known for, among other things, donating money in 2016 for the creation and installation of a statue of the Virgin Mary at the Valaam Monastery in Russia, regularly visited by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Boguslaev himself also visited the monastery - some media reported that the businessman met with the Russian president there, but the 'Motor Sich' press service denied these allegations."

news.184.d: "In response to Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine and constant threats towards NATO, Polish President Andrzej Duda requested the deployment of nuclear warheads on Polish territory from the USA. According to him, this decision is aimed at strengthening the country's security and deterring Russian influence. The USA responded to the request, and after debates in Congress and the Senate, nuclear warheads were successfully delivered to American military bases in Poland. Military analysts believe that this decision significantly strengthened the unity of the transatlantic alliance.\n\nNATO countries expressed support and solidarity with Poland, while Russia condemned the decision, calling it a provocation and a threat to international security. President Putin told the press that the Kremlin views the deployment of warheads as 'nuclear saber-rattling.'\n\nOverall, analysts also note that the deployment of US nuclear weapons in Poland is an important strategic step amid the escalating conflict with Russia. This event not only strengthens Poland's defense capabilities but also significantly alters the geopolitical balance of power in Europe, further straining relations between Russia and NATO."

Mayor of Lviv reported that part of the city lost power, forcing local authorities to close schools and universities. According to official Ukrainian sources, at least 23 people were killed, and over 100 were injured to varying degrees as a result of the strikes.

nato.11.t: "Diplomatic Stalemate with Russia"
nato.11.d: "Talks with Russia, which began in late 2021, have reached a deadlock. The goal was to find a compromise on security concerns and tension along NATO’s eastern borders. However, diplomatic efforts have yet to yield significant results. Russia continues to demand 'secure borders' and that NATO halt any further expansion, particularly towards its borders. At the same time, the alliance rejects these ultimatums, asserting its right to defend all member states and uphold its open-door policy for new members.\n\nThe NATO Council meeting took place in a tense atmosphere, as more alliance members called for a firmer stance towards Moscow. Intelligence reports indicate an increased Russian military presence near Ukraine’s borders, raising concerns among Eastern European countries and sparking discussions about a potential deployment of additional NATO forces in the region. There is a risk that further negotiations could end in a complete breakdown, and the situation could quickly escalate into a serious conflict in the coming months."

Meanwhile, NATO refuses to make concessions, considering them a violation of its principles and commitments to its allies.\n\nIn response to the heightened tension, NATO has proposed an emergency session of the NATO-Russia Council. This format, designed for addressing critical issues and preventing escalation, could represent the last chance for a diplomatic resolution. However, alliance members are divided on the approach: some call for a firm stance in negotiations, while others fear that excessive rigidity could worsen the situation."

The atmosphere is tense, and the strain in their voices is now impossible to hide.\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal leans forward on the table. His voice is restrained, but there is clear anger in his words.\n\n— Damn it, we cannot afford the luxury of waiting. Winter is coming, and people must have electricity. What reserves do we have?\n\nMinister of Energy Herman Halushchenko coughs slightly, glancing briefly at his papers. He has long since studied the data, and it does not inspire optimism.\n\n— The main distribution systems... everything has been blown to hell. We're relying on what's left, but, honestly, it's not enough to properly provide electricity to the entire country.\n\nDirector of the State Emergency Service Serhii Krus lowers his gaze, exhaling quietly. His face looks tired, and there is anger in his voice.\n\n— Fires, damage, restoring this damn network… our people are working until they collapse, damn it. The problem is, with each strike, we’re literally being wiped out. There's no time to prepare, none at all, we don't even know how to manage anymore.\n\nA heavy silence falls in the room. The Prime Minister surveys everyone, waiting, but no one rushes to speak. Finally, he raises his voice again:\n\n— Without the support of our allies, we’re in deep… (he pauses, struggling to find the words).

AFU drones increasingly enter DPR territory, the SBU more frequently extracts information from citizens about the administrative and military potential, and the Ukrainian border service asks more and more strange questions to those trying to leave or enter territories not controlled by Kyiv.

news.328.t: "Aid to Ukraine Postponed Again"
news.328.d: "Once again, the US Congress failed to advance the aid package for Ukraine. Amid growing divisions, the Republican Party is actively lobbying for a revision of the policy that combines issues of aid to Ukraine and tightening measures at the southern border.\n\nRepublican leaders argue that the country must focus on internal issues, such as the migration crisis, before allocating additional resources to the international arena. Initiatives to strengthen border control and tighten immigration laws are now going hand in hand with discussions on foreign policy aid, making decision-making significantly more difficult."

The attempt to push the initiative forward faced strong resistance from Republicans, who continue to insist on revising the bill that combines foreign aid and border security issues.\n\nRepublican representatives emphasized that without a revision of immigration laws and enhanced border control, the Ukraine aid package 'has no prospects for approval.' Meanwhile, Democrats and supporters of the initiative expressed their frustration, stating that the delay in support is causing significant damage to US international commitments."

However, the joy was short-lived: Senator Rand Paul once again used his leverage to delay the main vote.\nMeanwhile, Republicans continue to promote their initiative to create a comprehensive bill that combines aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and border control measures with Mexico. In their view, this strategy will address several key issues simultaneously and ensure support from both parties.\nDemocrats criticize such actions, arguing that combining such diverse issues complicates the process and jeopardizes urgent initiatives."

rus.196.t: "De-mothballing of ammunition"
rus.196.desc: "The situation with ammunition is becoming increasingly critical. The consumption of shells significantly exceeds the rate of their arrival, which leads to a shortage at the front lines. This limits the possibilities of conducting combat operations, reduces the intensity of fire support and forces us to conserve ammunition, even in situations where this is impossible. If supplies are not increased in the near future, the risks to the performance of combat missions will increase significantly. In order to stabilize the situation and ensure uninterrupted supplies, it is necessary to urgently de-mothball the existing stocks of shells and put them into use."
rus.196.a: "Let's begin"

rus.197.t: "The situation with ammunition has stabilized"
rus.197.desc: "Currently, the troops are fully supplied with ammunition, which allows them to conduct combat operations without restrictions. There are enough shells for both current tasks and possible intensive combat operations in the future. In the current situation, some of the ammunition can be redirected to warehouses, creating a strategic reserve that will be useful in the future. However, if necessary, all stocks can be left in combat units for immediate use, ensuring maximum firepower when needed."
rus.197.a: "Who doubted it?"

rus.198.t: "Return ammunition to warehouses"
rus.198.desc: "We will return the ammunition that was de-mothballed during difficult times and will have the opportunity to use de-mothballing again if the situation at the front requires it"
rus.198.a: "Agree"
