WGN_mission.1.d: "The goal facing us in terms of capturing the city of Bakhmut, at first glance, may seem cruel and inhumane: to crush as many Ukrainian troops as possible in this city. However, behind this goal lies strategic logic and an understanding of the importance of offensive operations in the context of a military conflict.\nThe city of Soledar will be the starting point.\nThe capture of the city of Soledar plays an important role in the strategy of encircling enemy troops in the city of Bakhmut. This is a key step that can ensure the successful implementation of the surrounding operation and give an advantage on the battlefield. That is why the capture Soledara is so important."

We inflicted significant damage on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but, unfortunately, were unable to achieve all the objectives of the operation. The Ukrainians concentrated under Bakhmut had huge forces, including tanks, special forces and artillery, so we had practically no opportunity to defeat Bandera’s followers. Evgeniy Viktorovich spoke about this in his press service and accused the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces of not providing adequate support to the group 'Wagner', which led to the failure of the Bakhmut Meat Grinder operation.

The General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces has already stated that are ready to respond to this act of aggression and use their forces to defend their territory.

RUS_event_33_desc_war: "On 18 March 2022 Moscow’s Luzhniki Grand Sports Arena hosted a huge rally-concert marking the eighth anniversary of Crimea’s and Sevastopol’s reunification with the Russian Federation. Organised by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the Civic Chamber, the event drew more than 203 000 people, according to the Moscow Interior Ministry: over 95 000 inside the stadium and around 108 000 on the grounds outside. Held under the slogans ‘Z for a world without Nazism’, ‘Z for Russia’ and ‘Z for the president’, it became a vivid display of Russian unity and patriotism.\n\nThe concert began at 15:00 Moscow time. Representatives of civic groups, youth organisations and ordinary Muscovites filled the stands. Despite crowding at the gates, the mood stayed festive, with field kitchens serving tea, porridge and hot dogs. The central moment was President Vladimir Putin’s speech, in which he stressed the importance of Crimea’s reunification and voiced support for the special military operation:\n\n“People living in Donbas did not accept the coup d’état. Punitive operations were launched against them—more than one. They were blockaded, shelled with artillery, bombed from the air. All this is what we call ‘genocide’.\n\nTo free people from this suffering, from this genocide—that is the main, compelling reason and goal of the military operation we began in Donbas and Ukraine. And here words from Holy Scripture come to mind: ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’”\n\nThe cultural programme featured Grigory Leps, Polina Gagarina, Oleg Gazmanov, Lyube, Timati and artists from Ukraine and the DPR. Speeches by public figures such as Vladimir Mashkov and Margarita Simonyan alternated with music. The stage was decked in tricolours and Z-symbols, while a live link to Sevastopol underlined the event’s nationwide nature."

rus.70.d: "Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich,\n\nI, Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Private Military Company, address you—as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation—with this open letter born of urgent necessity and deep responsibility for the fate of our Motherland and its people. My conscience and duty to the fighters who sacrifice their lives for Russia each day forbid me to remain silent when I see the blatant injustice, betrayal and criminal negligence undermining the success of the Special Military Operation and the future of our state.\n\nFor many months my men and I have faced systematic sabotage by the Ministry of Defence, in particular by Defence Minister Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov.\n\nUnder their leadership the MoD withholds ammunition from Wagner PMC, forcing our fighters to assault enemy positions without proper artillery preparation while depots overflow with shells. Their incompetent conduct of the Special Military Operation not only slows our advance but leads to the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and volunteers—criminal negligence bordering on treason. Russian men—the best sons of the Fatherland—die not from enemy fire but from shortages, poor coordination and inept orders—genocide of the Russian people. Rampant corruption, lack of discipline, nepotism and greed, indulged by these men, rot the army and drive it to self-destruction.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief and popularly elected President, I ask you to act. Investigate the MoD and General Staff; learn why your direct orders are ignored and sabotaged. Remove Shoigu and Gerasimov. Let us fight for Russia as we know how—with full commitment and free of rear-area intrigue.\n\nI believe in your resolve and that you will not allow private interests to endanger the state. For Russia, for our fighters, for victory—intervene.\nRespectfully and in hope of justice,\nYevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin"

Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov are professionals working in extremely difficult conditions. They do everything possible to supply our troops, and I trust their decisions.\n\nAs for shells—this is a complex issue tied to objective constraints. Nobody seeks to weaken anyone deliberately; we share one goal. Misunderstandings can be resolved in working order without excess emotion. Yevgeny speaks sharply out of love for the Motherland.

The military police are carrying out mass detentions of these individuals and promptly transporting them to special temporary accommodation centers A new neologism even appeared at the front - "Cargo 500", which is used to designate "refuseniks".

At one time, each of the flags was a state symbol of Russia, under each of them their victories, achievements and exploits were accomplished, but their trinity honors a centuries-old history.

If we start talking about greatness Soviet past - there is a risk of losing the loyalty of various kinds of nationalists and "turbo-patriots". But if they strike in the opposite direction it is dangerous - the left will not understand. And the idea of "common Russian patriotism" can either turn us all away, or, on the contrary, become something what will unite the Russian people in the current turbulent times.

Hour after hour, commanders of armored columns reported on the capture of more and more settlements , going deeper into enemy territory. It seemed that columns of armored vehicles would occupy the main cities of Ukraine without a single shot within just a few days. But in the end, all this turned out to be just an illusion. Receiving repulse from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our equipment fell into a jam and was one by one destroyed, unable to retreat in an orderly manner. One of the main tactics of the special operation in Ukraine, chosen by the General Staff, completely failed."

All targets operations "Mongoose Throw" were carried out. Zelensky's Nazi regime is no longer able to hold the front and will inevitably fall in the near future.

rus.158.desc: "No matter how successful the offensive in Ukraine was in the first days of the Special Military Operation, a month later all the shortcomings of army management and organization in the ranks of our troops were revealed. During the month of fighting, our soldiers failed to achieve all their goals, which actually means the failure of Operation Mongoose Throw and the disruption of the plans of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. Now the only correct decisions remain a total revision of our military doctrine, large-scale personnel changes and preparation for a long, protracted war..."

rus.182.desc: "It is necessary to resolve the issue of the composition of the interim government of Ukraine. Among the proposed options for the position of acting president, four main candidates can be highlighted:\n\nV.V. Medvedchuk - a state, public, and political figure of Ukraine. One of the founders of the pro-Russian party OPZZh. A figure close to Putin and the Russian authorities. Currently, the head of the interim military-civil administration of Kyiv. The most acceptable option.\n\nY.A. Boyko - a Ukrainian state and political figure. Member of OPZZh and Medvedchuk's right-hand man. In 2014, during negotiations with Ukraine, he was proposed by us for the position of head of the Luhansk region. He pursues a more moderate domestic policy, considering the interests of both Russia and the Ukrainian people.\n\nV.F. Yanukovych - former Ukrainian president, illegally overthrown as a result of the 2014 coup and fled to the Russian Federation. He pursued a balanced policy with a clear pro-Russian bias. He is the most legitimate candidate but extremely unpopular among the Ukrainian people.\n\nI.V. Kiva - former People's Deputy from OPZZh, member of the Committee on Legislative Support of Law Enforcement Activities. On the eve of the Special Operation, he left for Russia through Spain. He has an unpleasant past associated with the "Right Sector" and participation in hostilities in eastern Ukraine as part of the "Poltava" national battalion. He is radically opposed to the former Ukrainian junta. He has repeatedly spoken in support of President Putin's policy and the "merger" of Ukraine and Russia."

rus.183.desc: "Talks about the creation of Novorossiya have been ongoing since the very beginning of the conflict, almost immediately after the creation of the DPR and LPR. The confederation project "Union of People's Republics - Novorossiya" was adopted on May 24, 2014, resulting in the formation of the SNP Council, which included three representatives from both sides. On June 24-25, the Supreme Councils of the DPR and LPR delegated 30 deputies each to the future SNP parliament, and DPR Prime Minister Alexander Borodai announced that the union state would have its own constitution. However, the Second Minsk Agreements did not provide for the implementation of Novorossiya, due to which the project was frozen.\n\nNow, after the fall of the Kyiv regime, the possibility of implementing the confederation is again on everyone's lips. The heads of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics propose reviving the project, including all historical territories of Novorossiya liberated during the Special Operation in the new state. An equally popular proposal is to include these territories in the Russian Federation as new subjects. But one thing is clear - the future of eastern Ukraine is only with Russia."

The number of patriots willing to join the fight against the genocide of the Russian people is truly impressive. However, increasingly among them, we notice highly questionable individuals supporting ultra-right and openly neo-Nazi views. This is not new to us. The participation of such activists in battles on the side of the People's Republics has been recorded since 2014, but it has never been widely publicized or condemned.\n\nThe situation is made ambiguous by the dubious connections of the RID with foreign ultra-right organizations, particularly with §RAtomwaffen Division§!. AWD militants underwent combat training at 'Imperial Legion' facilities starting in 2015, and in 2020, a Russian cell of the organization—§RAtomwaffen Russland§!—was created under the wing of the imperialists. The movement’s ties to the Order of Nine Angles, a satanic and neo-pagan international terrorist network, also inspire little confidence. From its followers, a unit called §RAAST§! is being formed within the 'Imperial Legion.'\n\nAll of this stands in stark contrast to our official rhetoric about 'fighting Ukrainian neo-Nazism.' Nevertheless, as long as we can keep the radicals under control, we have nothing to worry about... Right?"

rus.200.desc: "The National Bolshevik Party 'The Other Russia,' founded by Eduard Limonov, has historically taken extremely radical positions regarding Ukraine. As early as 1992, Limonov openly stated: the conflict between Russians and Ukrainians would begin over Crimea. The demand to return Russia’s historical territories, including Crimea, Donbas, and Kharkov, became one of the key points of the party’s platform long before the events of 2014. Unsurprisingly, with the onset of the 'Russian Spring,' National Bolsheviks played a noticeable role in these processes.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, amidst the Crimea events, 'The Other Russia' announced the creation of the 'Crimean Tourism Enthusiasts Society.' An application form for volunteers appeared on the party’s online resources, including a question about 'Military Specialty.' Soon, anti-Kyiv sentiments spread to the territories of Novorossiya. Donbas and Kharkov became particularly hot zones, where party activists from Crimea headed. Among them stood out figures like Benes Ayo, a Latvian National Bolshevik nicknamed 'Black Lenin' for his fiery speeches at rallies in Donetsk, and Rostislav Zhuravlyov, a journalist from Yekaterinburg who participated in assaults on regional administrations in both Kharkov and Donetsk. In April 2014, 'The Other Russia' organized a thematic 'Ukrainian Congress,' and on May 6—just days after the tragic events in Odessa—the party announced the creation of the Volunteer Movement 'Interbrigades.' Its participants actively joined the defense of the Donbas People’s Republics against the Ukrainian junta that had seized power in Kyiv.\n\nWhen our president announced the start of the Special Military Operation to protect the Donbas population, the National Bolsheviks greeted it with immense enthusiasm. 'The Other Russia' is actively preparing to send numerous volunteers to Ukraine eager to participate in the liberation of Donbas and is also collecting humanitarian aid for the residents of the People’s Republics. Some party activists have also proposed reorganizing the 'Interbrigades' movement into a full-fledged volunteer formation within the Russian Armed Forces. A corresponding proposal has already been submitted to the Ministry of Defense."

The issue of appealing to the president about the need to recognize the DPR and LPR was considered by the State Duma based on a ranked voting system, where the option receiving the most votes is selected. Two draft resolutions were put forward: one from the Communist Party (CPRF) and one from 'United Russia.' The latter proposed consultations with the Foreign Ministry, while the communists’ version was to be sent directly to the president.\n\n351 deputies voted for the communists’ initiative, 16 opposed, and one abstained. 310 deputies supported the United Russia draft.\n\n'By a majority of votes, resolution number 58243-8, titled "On the Appeal of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on the Need to Recognize the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic," is adopted.

The Supreme Commander-in-Chief begins with a general overview of the situation in Ukraine since 2014.\n\n«We have gathered here today to discuss the situation unfolding in Donbas.\n\nIn brief, I will remind you of what has been happening there from the beginning and how the situation has evolved, although you all know this perfectly well. Nevertheless, this is to provide a comprehensive picture that will help us make the appropriate decisions. So, after the coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014, part of the population of that country did not accept this coup. Let me remind you that it was an unconstitutional and bloody coup, as many innocent people died during those events. It was, indeed, an armed coup—no one disputes that. A portion, I repeat, of the citizens of that country did not accept this coup. This applied to the people living in Crimea, and it applied—and still applies—to those living in Donbas.\n\nThe people declared that they were forming two independent republics—the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. From that moment, a confrontation began between the Kyiv authorities and the people living in that territory. In this regard, I would like to draw attention to the fact that Russia initially did everything possible to resolve all the resulting contradictions peacefully, by peaceful means. Nevertheless, the Kyiv authorities conducted two military punitive operations in those territories, and it seems we are now witnessing an escalation for the third time.»\n\nLater, the attending representatives of various state structures will also express their opinions on resolving the Donbas crisis."

Dear colleagues!\n\nAs I previously reported, we have assessed the responses from the United States and NATO to our proposals on security guarantees. Our Western colleagues rejected key initiatives, including the non-expansion of NATO eastward, citing the 'open door' policy and freedom of choice. The principle of the indivisibility of security, on which we rely, is being ignored, particularly the condition that the security of one must not be strengthened at the expense of another.\n\nWe sent letters to our Western partners with an analysis of OSCE commitments and Russia-NATO agreements, including the 1997 Founding Act. We proposed returning NATO’s force configuration on the eastern flank to the state of 1997, but this was also rejected. In response, they urged us to 'end the occupation of Crimea' and withdraw troops from Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. suggested discussing restrictions on intermediate-range missiles, even though they themselves withdrew from the treaty with Russia. Issues of reducing military risks and increasing transparency were also raised, but these topics were taken out of the broader context.\n\nOur impression is that Western partners are trying to cherry-pick secondary aspects while avoiding discussion of key issues such as NATO expansion and the configuration of its forces. They tie dialogue to de-escalation around Ukraine.\n\nWe will continue our work, insisting on the integrity of our initiatives. We are ready to discuss U.S. proposals, but only in the context of addressing the main questions: halting NATO’s expansion and reviewing its military presence in Europe.\n\nPer your instructions, the documents have been sent to Washington. Secretary of State Blinken expressed readiness to discuss them at a meeting scheduled for this week in Geneva. We will proceed within the framework of the positions you have approved."

Their goal is to freeze the conflict, placing the political and economic responsibility on Russia, including the maintenance of Donbas.\n\nWe are spending enormous resources on humanitarian support for these territories. At the same time, there is a labor shortage in Donbas: the number of vacancies exceeds the number of unemployed by 2.5 times. This is a result of our measures, including the issuance of passports, which may contradict economic goals.\n\nUkraine and the West are not interested in resolving the conflict. Any question about returning Donbas under Ukrainian control leaves them dumbfounded. They simply remain silent, unsure of how to respond.\n\nAs for Donbas, there’s probably no need to explain the political and economic reasons that...\n\nV.

As a result, 90% of Donetsk is without water, and two-thirds of Lugansk is without gas. Most residents near the contact line have been evacuated, but some remain due to work at continuous-cycle enterprises. Today, a miner was killed by an artillery shell. Over the past night, there were more than 40 shelling incidents, all targeted at pre-designated locations.\n\nOn the borders of the Lugansk and Donetsk regions, 59,300 Ukrainian servicemen are concentrated, along with 345 tanks, 2,160 armored combat vehicles, 820 artillery pieces and mortars, and 160 multiple-launch rocket systems, including Smerch systems. Heavy equipment, contrary to agreements, has been returned to positions. Additionally, nationalist battalions, poorly controlled by central command, are operating, leading to sabotage, terrorist acts, and infrastructure destruction.\n\nA particular danger stems from Zelensky’s statement about restoring Ukraine’s status as a nuclear state. Ukraine retains the technology, equipment, and specialists to create nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, such as Tochka-U. This, combined with the activity of nationalist units, creates an extremely tense situation.\n\nOver the past month, escalation has been observed: equipment is being redeployed, radio frequencies are changing, and shelling has intensified. The situation is approaching the levels of 2014–2015, indicating preparation for major provocations or a military resolution of the Donbas issue."

These are, in fact, the 'red lines' that the President of the country has repeatedly spoken about at various forums and during various meetings.\n\nWe face a difficult choice—whether to recognize the independence of the DPR and LPR. The experience of 2008 with the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia showed that such decisions save lives and serve as a lesson for NATO. Today, the situation is more complex due to the scale of the potential conflict, but simpler because we know what to expect from the West: sanctions and pressure. However, as experience has shown, over time the tension subsides, and partners themselves return to dialogue.\n\nAround 800,000 Russian citizens live in the DPR and LPR.

This is an attempt to provoke Kyiv into a military resolution of the Donbas issue, which we cannot allow. Millions of people live in these territories, wanting to speak Russian and honor their history.\n\nAs with Crimea, where Russia supported the will of the people expressed in a referendum, we are obliged to act now.

The only one implemented was when Ukrainian troops were withdrawn and pulled back, and even then, it was done with the expectation that Ukraine believes the day will come when they gather their strength, gain the capability, and resolve this issue by force.\n\nThe next page of this picture, or this book, is the arming of Ukraine. It continues with unclear goals and unclear objectives. They already have so much weaponry there that it’s enough for many large and small conflicts, which they persistently ignite in the territories of both the Lugansk and Donetsk republics.\n\nBut when four, five, or even eight flights of weapons arrive daily—modern weapons—and they call it defensive, it’s hard for me to imagine that Javelins, for instance, are defensive weapons.

Of course, my address is also directed to our compatriots in Ukraine. I will have to speak at length and in detail. The matter is very serious.\n\nThe situation in Donbass has once again taken on a critical, acute character. And today I am addressing you directly, not only to assess what is happening but also to inform you about the decisions being made and the possible further steps in this direction.\n\nSo, I will begin with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely and completely created by Russia, or more precisely, by Bolshevik, communist Russia. This process began almost immediately after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was quite harsh toward Russia itself – by separating, tearing away part of its own historical territories. Naturally, no one asked the millions of people living there for their opinion.\n\nI am not blaming anyone or anything now; the situation in the country at that time, after the Civil War and before it, was incredibly complex and critical. Today, I only want to say that this is exactly how it happened. It is a historical fact. As I have already said, as a result of Bolshevik policy, Soviet Ukraine emerged, which even today can rightfully be called ‘Ukraine named after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.’ He is its author and architect. This is fully confirmed by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh directives regarding Donbass, which was literally forced into Ukraine. And now the ‘grateful descendants’ have torn down Lenin’s monuments in Ukraine. They call it decommunization.\n\n§RYou want decommunization? Well, that suits us just fine. But there’s no need, as they say, to stop halfway. We are ready to show you what real decommunization means for Ukraine.§!»"

And starting from 1991, it embarked on a path of mechanically copying foreign models, detached from both its history and Ukrainian realities. Political and state institutions were constantly reshaped to suit the rapidly formed clans with their own selfish interests, which had nothing in common with the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nStable statehood never took root in Ukraine, and political and electoral procedures serve merely as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property among various oligarchic clans.\n\nCorruption, which is undoubtedly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has taken on a particularly unique character in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power. Radicals took advantage of the people’s justified discontent, hijacked the protest, and in 2014 turned the Maidan into a coup d’état. The radicals who seized power organized persecution, outright terror against those who opposed the unconstitutional actions. It is impossible to recall without horror the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where participants in a peaceful protest were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions.\n\nHow long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can it be endured? Russia did everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity, persistently and patiently fighting for years to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which enshrined the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to resolve the situation in Donbass. All in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies change, but the essence, the aggressive, nationalist character of the regime that seized power in Kyiv, does not.\n\n§RIn this regard, I consider it necessary to make a long-overdue decision – to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic.§!»"

The people of Luhansk stood up to defend themselves and their land.\n\nThe Luhansk Republic, along with Donetsk, became a symbol of the revival of the Russian world. An honest and open referendum was held in the Republic, in which the overwhelming majority of residents voted for independence from Ukraine. But Kiev nationalists, encouraged by their Western masters, unleashed a war against the peaceful population of Donbass, wishing to eradicate the Russian people and culture.\n\nDespite the offensive actions by the Ukrainian Army militants, the LPR militias managed to hold the defense and protect their native cities from the Banderite bloodsuckers. After the Minsk agreements were concluded, the situation in the Republic began to slowly stabilize.

Chechens know the motto all too well. Memories—and a bitter aftertaste—remain from those calls for freedom or death. Yet death is inevitable anyway, and what exactly did that proclaimed freedom mean?\n\nOur dear brother Khusein Dzhambetov was once an ardent supporter of \"Freedom or Death\" during the Ichkeria period and later continued his agitation from abroad. Recently he returned to Grozny and admitted he had been deeply mistaken. I met him on Friday after dhuhr prayer and asked where the limits of the freedom he shouted about lay. What did that freedom mean to them?\n\nFreedom to attend mosques and follow the Qur'an and Sunnah? There are no restrictions here—recitation of the Qur'an is heard not only in homes and religious institutions but in the streets. Access to medicine, education, sport? All doors are open. Maybe the Ichkerians were worried about preserving Chechen traditions, customs, language? We are working on that too, with entire institutes dedicated to these tasks. So where is the problem?\n\nKhusein reached the same conclusions. He came back and asked people to forgive his false notions of freedom and the mistakes he made.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Armed Forces prepared for street battles and a long siege inside the Dnieper, and also evacuated the remnants of the population.\nResidential areas in the south of the city were the first to suffer. Areas consisting exclusively from apartment buildings, became the main target of Russian artillery. Advancing with a barrage of fire, Russian soldiers gradually occupied the devastated areas of the Dnieper. Ultimately, due to lack of supplies, the Ukrainian Armed Forces had to abandon the southern regions, blow up bridges across the Dnieper, and retreat to their main fortress - Dnieper Metallurgical Plant.

Our fighters are used to acting decisively rather than counting every shell. Commanders are puzzled: why slash ammo deliveries when the strategic initiative is shifting into our hands?\n\nWithin Wagner the old friction with the General Staff—dating back to the 2018 Syria events—is being recalled more and more often. Many believe that poor coordination and Ministry of Defence bureaucracy back then cost us dearly.

My conscience and my duty to the fighters who daily sacrifice their lives for Russia do not allow me to remain silent when I witness blatant injustice, betrayal and criminal negligence undermining the success of the Special Military Operation and the future of our state.\n\nFor many months my men and I have faced systematic sabotage by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, in particular by Defence Minister Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov.\n\nUnder their leadership the Ministry of Defence continually withholds ammunition from Wagner PMC, forcing our fighters to assault enemy positions without proper artillery preparation while warehouses overflow with shells; their incompetent conduct of the Special Military Operation not only slows our advance but leads to the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and volunteers—conduct that can only be described as criminal negligence verging on treason; Russian men—the best sons of the Fatherland—are dying not so much because of the enemy’s actions as from lack of resources, poor coordination and ruinous orders, which can fairly be called genocide of the Russian people; moreover, rampant corruption, lack of discipline, nepotism and greed, indulged by the above-named individuals, are morally rotting the army and driving it to self-destruction.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, I implore you, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief and as the popularly elected President of Russia, to deal with this situation. Investigate the actions of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff. Find out why your direct orders are ignored and sabotaged. Remove Shoigu and Gerasimov from command of the army. Let us fight for Russia as we know how—with full commitment and without rear-area intrigue.\n\nI believe in your resolve and that you will not allow the personal interests of a few to endanger the interests of the state.

The PMC has no legal status in Russia, and its activity falls under Article 359 of the Criminal Code (mercenarism). Yet Prigozhin’s ties to President Putin have allowed the group not only to operate outside Russian law but also to receive substantial government funding.\n\nSince 2014 Wagner has been active in conflicts advancing Russian interests. In 2014–2015 it fought in eastern Ukraine, backing separatists at Luhansk Airport and Debaltseve while giving the Kremlin plausible deniability. From 2015 the PMC took part in operations in Syria, supporting Bashar al-Assad, guarding oil fields and fighting for Palmyra. From 2017 it expanded into Africa (CAR, Sudan, Libya, Mali, Mozambique), providing security for regimes, training forces and safeguarding Russian economic interests in exchange for resource access (gold, diamonds, uranium).\n\nBy January 2022 Wagner had forged a reputation for toughness in the harshest battles worldwide—from the blazing fields of Donbas to the deserts of Syria and the jungles of Central Africa. Iron discipline, rigorous training and unyielding resilience became its hallmarks, enabling it to succeed where others faltered. As tensions rose around Ukraine and threats mounted to Russian-speaking civilians, Wagner stood ready, at the Motherland’s call, to redeploy eastward—bringing the battle-tested skills and steely resolve of the “Orchestra.”"

However, we have now conducted searches, revealing schemes for embezzling 40 billion hryvnias from the companies 'Ukrnafta' and 'Ukrtatnafta'. The SBU reminds us that PJSC 'Ukrnafta' is Ukraine's largest oil production company, and PJSC 'Ukrtatnafta' is the largest oil refinery. Currently, 10 episodes of criminal activity are being documented within the criminal case. The case materials mention Kolomoisky as a person deprived of Ukrainian citizenship and a citizen of Israel and Cyprus. Additionally, the SAP and NABU have informed Kolomoisky of the suspicion; he is suspected of embezzling 9.2 billion hryvnias from PrivatBank as the former ultimate beneficiary. The actions of all revealed individuals are qualified as crimes under Articles 191, 209, 366 of the Criminal Code, depending on each person's role in the criminal scheme. Similarly, NABU temporarily seized Kolomoisky's assets, as known from a decision by the Kyiv Court of Appeal. The Shevchenko District Court of Kyiv sent businessman Ihor Kolomoisky into custody for 60 days, with the possibility of posting bail in the amount of 509 million hryvnias. 'It has been established that from 2013 to 2020, Ihor Kolomoisky laundered more than half a billion hryvnias by transferring them abroad using the infrastructure of controlled banking institutions,' noted the SBU. The investigation continues..."

According to the SBU, the arrest occurred as part of a criminal proceeding regarding the illegal supply of military goods by 'Motor Sich' for Russian assault aviation. 'According to the investigation materials, the plant's management in Zaporizhzhia was involved in the deal. The officials conspired with representatives of the Russian corporation 'Rostec,' which is one of the main producers of weapons for the Russian Armed Forces,' the SBU reported. The occupiers used the received products for the production and repair of Russian attack helicopters, which they have used extensively for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the Zaporizhzhia city portal 'ZaBor,' Boguslaev's home was searched, with law enforcement having to break down doors as Boguslaev's family refused to open them. The businessman was detained and taken under escort to Kyiv. The head of 'Motor Sich' is also known for, among other things, donating money in 2016 for the creation and installation of a statue of the Virgin Mary at the Valaam Monastery in Russia, regularly visited by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Boguslaev himself also visited the monastery - some media reported that the businessman met with the Russian president there, but the 'Motor Sich' press service denied these allegations."

This is not only a security problem for your country, but a challenge for the whole continent, especially Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nAt the moment, the key is to strengthen Ukraine's defence capabilities. Both by equipping the Armed Forces on the border with Russia and by strengthening NATO forces on the eastern flank. So far, these measures are taking place chaotically, but unity and unambiguous movements are needed.\n\nMoreover, the European Union should already today present Vladimir Putin with a plan for the sanctions and economic retaliation that await Russia if it tries to violate Ukraine's border. Vladimir Putin should know that any attempt to start a war will bring economic disaster to Russia.\n\n'I believe Moscow will come to its senses and not start another war in Europe.

According to him, this decision is aimed at strengthening the country's security and deterring Russian influence. The USA responded to the request, and after debates in Congress and the Senate, nuclear warheads were successfully delivered to American military bases in Poland. Military analysts believe that this decision significantly strengthened the unity of the transatlantic alliance.\n\nNATO countries expressed support and solidarity with Poland, while Russia condemned the decision, calling it a provocation and a threat to international security. President Putin told the press that the Kremlin views the deployment of warheads as 'nuclear saber-rattling.'\n\nOverall, analysts also note that the deployment of US nuclear weapons in Poland is an important strategic step amid the escalating conflict with Russia. This event not only strengthens Poland's defense capabilities but also significantly alters the geopolitical balance of power in Europe, further straining relations between Russia and NATO."

nato.11.t: "Diplomatic Stalemate with Russia"
nato.11.d: "Talks with Russia, which began in late 2021, have reached a deadlock. The goal was to find a compromise on security concerns and tension along NATO’s eastern borders. However, diplomatic efforts have yet to yield significant results. Russia continues to demand 'secure borders' and that NATO halt any further expansion, particularly towards its borders. At the same time, the alliance rejects these ultimatums, asserting its right to defend all member states and uphold its open-door policy for new members.\n\nThe NATO Council meeting took place in a tense atmosphere, as more alliance members called for a firmer stance towards Moscow. Intelligence reports indicate an increased Russian military presence near Ukraine’s borders, raising concerns among Eastern European countries and sparking discussions about a potential deployment of additional NATO forces in the region. There is a risk that further negotiations could end in a complete breakdown, and the situation could quickly escalate into a serious conflict in the coming months."

nato.12.t: "NATO-Russia Council"
nato.12.d: "Negotiations between NATO and Russia have reached an impasse. Despite numerous meetings and statements, key security issues remain unresolved. Russia continues to demand guarantees that new members, particularly Ukraine, will not join the alliance, and insists on NATO withdrawing its forces from the eastern borders. Meanwhile, NATO refuses to make concessions, considering them a violation of its principles and commitments to its allies.\n\nIn response to the heightened tension, NATO has proposed an emergency session of the NATO-Russia Council. This format, designed for addressing critical issues and preventing escalation, could represent the last chance for a diplomatic resolution. However, alliance members are divided on the approach: some call for a firm stance in negotiations, while others fear that excessive rigidity could worsen the situation."

NATO asserts that such actions undermine stability in Europe and increase tension on the alliance’s eastern borders.\n\nWestern countries perceive Russian maneuvers as a threat to the security of Ukraine and NATO allies. In response to Russia’s actions, the alliance is calling for an immediate reduction in military presence and withdrawal from Ukraine’s borders, warning of consequences in case of further escalation. At the same time, the note emphasizes that dialogue remains open if Russia is willing to discuss de-escalation."

Representatives from Western countries reaffirm their commitment to the principles of security and Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, the Russian delegation advocates for security guarantees and condemns NATO’s eastward expansion, calling it a direct threat.\n\nThe Ukrainian President's speech on the country’s readiness to defend its territory received a wave of applause, while proposals by European and American leaders to expand sanctions against Russia met with mixed reactions. The conference also discussed possible sanctions, arms supplies, and diplomatic measures aimed at containing escalation.

The atmosphere in the meeting room is both tense and resolute: the ministers are discussing long-term defense plans and immediate steps to prevent potential escalation.\n\nSome member states are calling for bolstered eastern borders and increased EU military presence in key regions to demonstrate a commitment to protecting shared interests. Other ministers voice concerns that aggressive measures could worsen the situation and lead to conflict. The question of coordination with NATO and the potential provision of military aid to EU partner states on the borders is also raised.\n\nThe outcome of the meeting could determine the future of European security and the strategic role of the EU amid rising threats."

Attendees expressed support for Finland, emphasizing that the alliance's expansion is a response to new challenges and threats. For NATO member states, Finland's accession is a significant step toward strengthening the alliance's eastern flank, now providing direct access to a large portion of Russia's northern border.\n\nThe Russian leadership condemned the decision, stating that NATO's eastern expansion disrupts the security balance in the region.

Sweden's entry grants NATO access to strategically vital areas in the Baltic Sea and fortifies the alliance's eastern flank. NATO allies view this event as a key step in deterring potential threats and bolstering regional security.\n\nRussian officials condemned the decision, claiming NATO's expansion undermines the security balance in Northern Europe.

AFU drones increasingly enter DPR territory, the SBU more frequently extracts information from citizens about the administrative and military potential, and the Ukrainian border service asks more and more strange questions to those trying to leave or enter territories not controlled by Kyiv. OSCE observers increasingly show interest in the positions of the 1st Army Corps, appearing in places where they clearly should not be. At the same time, unofficial resources linked to the DPR People's Militia inform the internet that the militia forces are far from their peak military capabilities."

bridges_destroyed_news.20.d: "A colossal blast has obliterated the Dnipro Hydropower Plant in Zaporizhzhia—the largest station on the cascade—creating a 410-km² reservoir. The dam’s failure unleashed catastrophic flooding across residential and industrial zones. The loss of 1 538 MW cripples Ukraine’s energy grid; river transport is halted, logistics paralysed. As the cascade’s core regulator, its destruction threatens knock-on failures at Kakhovka. Expect chronic power shortages, agricultural collapse, economic losses and a humanitarian crisis. Restoration is impossible; the region teeters on the brink."

The 357-MW loss cripples southern Ukraine’s grid; lower-Dnipro navigation is halted and irrigation systems vital for up to 20 % of grain exports are ruined.

bridges_destroyed_news.28.d: "A massive explosion has leveled the 19-km Crimean Bridge—the largest single infrastructure link between the peninsula and Russia’s Krasnodar Krai across the Kerch Strait.  It carried the main flow of military, civilian and freight traffic, supplying Crimea with fuel, food and equipment.  With the span gone, all land routes to the peninsula are cut and Crimea is isolated from mainland Russia.  Tourism and transit-dependent industries collapse; shortages of essentials spark panic buying.  Debris disrupts Azov Sea shipping lanes.  Long-term fallout is dire: isolation, humanitarian crisis, ecological damage and social unrest.  Re-building is impossible for years; the region teeters on the brink of systemic failure."

ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.t: "Operation “Spiderweb”"
ukr_spiderweb_operation.1.d: "Leaked reports today reveal a coordinated Ukrainian drone strike on multiple Russian airbases—not with missiles, but swarms of UAVs.  It remains unclear whether the blast that damaged a Crimean-Bridge pier and the concentrated hits in Bryansk and Moscow oblasts form part of “Spiderweb,” yet by nightfall the tally speaks for itself: factory damage at JSC **Kronshtadt** (builder of Russian drones) and attacks on the Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya bases.  Preliminary counts suggest at least 12 VKS aircraft destroyed—7 Tu-95s, 4 Tu-22s and an An-12 (CSIS confirms 14 Ukraine’s General Staff claims 41). The raid—equal parts audacity and meticulous planning—used FPV drones hidden beneath makeshift container roofs, moved by civilian trucks.  When the SBU gave the word, each roof slid open and the launch began.  Russia’s aerospace plants cannot quickly replace strategic bombers; most contracts cover deep modernisation of Soviet airframes, not new builds.  Whether the strikes stall peace talks or trigger “revenge strikes” is uncertain, but analysts agree: Russia cannot ramp up aircraft output any time soon.  The world now watches for Moscow’s next move."

ukr_hidden.1.d: "Latest reports say that on Sunday, 30 January, Rinat Akhmetov and Viktor Pinchuk flew out of Boryspil Airport."
ukr_hidden.1.a: "Too early"

ukr_hidden.2.t: "Second Wave of Oligarch Flight"
ukr_hidden.2.d: "According to fresh information, 10 February saw Novinskyi, Yaroslavskyi and Abramovych leave the country."
ukr_hidden.2.a: "Do they sense something?"

ukr_hidden.3.t: "Third Wave of Oligarch Flight"
ukr_hidden.3.d: "On 13 February, Nesternenko, Stolar and Khmelnytskyi reportedly departed."
ukr_hidden.3.a: "Soon…"

ukr_election.1.t: "Shall We Prepare Elections?"
ukr_election.1.d: "While resisting full-scale aggression, Ukraine strives to keep its democracy alive. Debate is growing over holding elections during wartime. How to cope with legal, logistical and security hurdles? What of soldiers’ votes, IDPs and citizens abroad? From constitutional norms to international observers, questions abound; answers do not—yet the discussion is under way."
ukr_election.1.a: "No"
ukr_election.1.b: "Absolutely not"
ukr_election.1.c: "Martial law forbids it"

ukr_hidden.4.t: "One Million Shells per Year"
ukr_hidden.4.d: "With the front’s acute needs and shaky foreign supplies, boosting domestic defence production is ever more urgent. Ukraine is scaling up, but tens of thousands are not enough—millions are needed. One million shells a year is the bold target for state and private plants. Are resources, capacity and manpower sufficient? The future depends not only on allies, but on our own assembly lines."
ukr_hidden.4.a: "We can do it!"
ukr_hidden.5.t: "We Produced Over a Million Shells!"
ukr_hidden.5.d: "We set ourselves an ambitious goal—and met it. In one year we produced more than 1 000 000 shells. This is the result of coordinated work by engineers, labourers, logisticians—everyone who poured hour after hour into the nation’s defence. We modernised workshops, launched new lines, solved dozens of problems every day—and never stopped. Today our shells are not just a number; they are a force working for victory. Production continues, and this is only the beginning."
ukr_hidden.5.a: "Let’s drink to that!"

ukr_hidden.6.t: "Did We Really Do It?"
ukr_hidden.6.d: "We made over a million shells—yes, we did. Lines never stopped, shifts skipped breaks, schedules bent for one thing—results were needed ‘yesterday’. And we delivered. But now, with warehouses full and the figure impressive, it’s time to look deeper: dispersion, unstable trajectories, fitting and casing flaws—these aren’t mere details. We won’t stop. We’ll refine, learn from mistakes and tighten control. A million is power. But an accurate million—that’s victory."
ukr_hidden.6.a: "What a fiasco…"

ukr_hidden.7.t: "Bad News from the Front"
ukr_hidden.7.d: "We were proud of the figure—one million shells sounded strong. But worrying signals are coming from the front. Videos show some rounds fail to detonate, veer off or even break up on firing. Commanders complain of batch instability; crews fear for their lives. We hear them. In war every minute counts, but every round must be reliable. Production won’t stop, but lessons will be learned. Quantity matters—yet quality is the harder goal ahead."
ukr_hidden.7.a: "Hmm…"

ukr.795.t: "Oligarchs Agree"
ukr.795.d: "Amid worrying border news and rising tension, Ukrainian oligarchs met government representatives. For the first time in ages, a single stance emerged: they will provide financial aid. Participants pledged to coordinate efforts, support defence and energy, and stay out of politics. ‘This is no time for internal games—time to unite,’ the joint statement said."
ukr.795.a: "Finally, good news"

ukr.796.t: "Oligarchs Will Help—For a Price?"
ukr.796.d: "A meeting with big business came against a backdrop of instability. The oligarchs confirmed readiness to help—on one condition: anti-corruption reforms are off the table for now. ‘We’re not against change, just not when everything could blow up. The priority is stability,’ said one participant. Help is offered in exchange for a ‘pause’ on oversight and transparency."
ukr.796.a: "Questionable, but okay"

ukr.797.t: "Oligarchs Refuse"
ukr.797.d: "This time agreement proved impossible. Key business groups walked away from state-support programmes, citing distrust of governance and fears for their assets. ‘No clear rules, no guarantees, no accountability,’ they said. The government is left without the resources it expected."
ukr.797.a: "Fine"

ukr.798.t: "Poroshenko Returns to Kyiv"
ukr.798.d: "On 17 January 2022 former president Petro Poroshenko flew into Kyiv to attend a court hearing on possible treason. He was not detained at the airport and went straight to Pechersk Court. The return caused a political stir and drew supporters to the courthouse. The court imposed a personal recognisance bond. Poroshenko called the case politically motivated."
ukr.798.a: "Is democracy over?"

ukr.799.t: "Sich Satellite Launched"
ukr.799.d: "On 13 January 2022 a SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully launched Ukraine’s Earth-observation satellite ‘Sich-2-30’. It is the first Ukrainian satellite in a decade, part of the state space programme. The craft will monitor resources, ecology, emergencies and defence needs."
ukr.799.a: "Awesome"

ukr.800.t: "General Staff Shake-Up"
ukr.800.d: "Personnel changes at the top command have been announced. A new chief of staff and first deputy—already touted as the ideal duo for tough times—have front-line experience, good reputations and troop backing. Insiders say ‘complete mutual understanding and a shared goal’ bind them. Faster reform planning and higher readiness are expected."
ukr.800.a: "Zaluzhnyi, Zaluzhnyi and Zaluzhnyi again!"
ukr.800.b: "Syrskyi has proven himself"
ukr.800.c: "Maybe Biletsky?"
ukr.800.d: "More options"

ukr.801.t: "Alternative Appointments Criticised"
ukr.801.d: "The shake-up in the General Staff sparked backlash inside the ranks. The new duo is seen by some as weak and unbalanced, lacking authority. Officers note the appointees haven’t shone in crises. ‘Not the ones to lean on in a hard hour,’ said a source. The decision is branded political and ill-timed."
ukr.801.a: "Prokopenko?"
ukr.801.d: "Drapaty?"

ukr.802.t: "On What Basis Should We Build Our PMC?"
ukr.802.d: "Sources close to defence say the General Staff is weighing two options for setting up private military companies: build on Special Operations Forces personnel, or adapt regular brigades for autonomous work. Trust, control and effectiveness on critical axes will decide."
ukr.802.a: "Use the SOF!"
ukr.802.b: "Use regular units!"

ukr.803.t: "PMC Based on SOF"
ukr.803.d: "Debate favoured the SOF as the core for experimental PMC structures. Official confirmation is pending, but SOF fighters showed the autonomy, discipline and efficiency needed for high-intensity war. Pilot units are already forming—quality over mass."
ukr.803.a: "Skilled, but few"

ukr.804.t: "PMC Based on Regular Units"
ukr.804.d: "Contrary to expectations, the GS opted to form PMCs from regular army brigades—scale, manpower and logistics already in place. Critics warn of control and discipline risks; supporters say scaling and flexible formats are easier. Pilot structures are under way, limited in scope."
ukr.804.a: "Less skilled, but many"

In a single sortie their home-built FPV kamikaze drones destroyed several armoured vehicles on the Donetsk axis.\n\nJust before impact the now-viral cry ‘Djaga-djaga!’ rings out, after which the camera erupts in flash and flame. The meme lifts Ukrainian morale while Russian crews frantically weld on more ‘barbecue cages’.\n\nAnalysts note: cheap FPVs in skilled hands shift battles faster than either side can react with traditional supplies. Kyiv has already announced programme scaling, Moscow calls the clips ‘staged’. But on the line, Russian “yoblyks” keep getting hit."

RUS_event_33_desc_war: "On 18 March 2022 Moscow’s Luzhniki Grand Sports Arena hosted a huge rally-concert marking the eighth anniversary of Crimea’s and Sevastopol’s reunification with the Russian Federation. Organised by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the Civic Chamber, the event drew more than 203 000 people, according to the Moscow Interior Ministry: over 95 000 inside the stadium and around 108 000 on the grounds outside. Held under the slogans ‘Z for a world without Nazism’, ‘Z for Russia’ and ‘Z for the president’, it became a vivid display of Russian unity and patriotism.\n\nThe concert began at 15:00 Moscow time. Representatives of civic groups, youth organisations and ordinary Muscovites filled the stands. Despite crowding at the gates, the mood stayed festive, with field kitchens serving tea, porridge and hot dogs. The central moment was President Vladimir Putin’s speech, in which he stressed the importance of Crimea’s reunification and voiced support for the special military operation:\n\n“People living in Donbas did not accept the coup d’état. Punitive operations were launched against them—more than one. They were blockaded, shelled with artillery, bombed from the air. All this is what we call ‘genocide’.\n\nTo free people from this suffering, from this genocide—that is the main, compelling reason and goal of the military operation we began in Donbas and Ukraine. And here words from Holy Scripture come to mind: ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’”\n\nThe cultural programme featured Grigory Leps, Polina Gagarina, Oleg Gazmanov, Lyube, Timati and artists from Ukraine and the DPR. Speeches by public figures such as Vladimir Mashkov and Margarita Simonyan alternated with music. The stage was decked in tricolours and Z-symbols, while a live link to Sevastopol underlined the event’s nationwide nature."

According to him, in February 2022 there was no real threat from Ukraine or NATO—the generals invented one so that ‘the freak Shoygu could grab a Marshal’s star’. Kyiv never planned to storm the Donbas, and a major war could have been avoided.\n\nPrigozhin says the campaign was mis-planned from the start. The MoD was unprepared for real combat; chaos, lack of strategy and indifference to soldiers’ lives led to catastrophic losses. Unlike those who hide behind reports, he is not afraid to name figures and speak truth—praising the heroism of fighters, including former convicts who “washed their guilt away with blood”.\n\nHe contrasts the self-sacrifice of the front-line with the cynical indifference of Shoygu and Gerasimov who cling to power at the cost of others’ lives. He states that the President often receives embellished sit-reps far from reality.\n\nThese words, Prigozhin insists, are not ‘whining’ or ‘panic’ but a bitter truth inconvenient to the Kremlin careerists."

An explosion blew the roof off a liquid-chlorine tank—rescuers estimate that more than three thousand tonnes of the hazardous substance were instantly released into the atmosphere.\nA chlorine cloud blanketed Gdynia’s industrial zone and some residential quarters: emergency services hastily evacuated tens of thousands, sealing roads to Sopot and Gdańsk.

The body of evidence bears the hallmarks of Russian GRU special units, yet several elements suggest either domestic complicity or an attempt to stage the ‘perfect Russian trace’.\n\nKey evidence of *external direction*:\n1. VDM-4 charge (RDX : TNT ≈ 68 : 32) — identical to devices used in previous terror attacks.\n2. 433.92 MHz radio link (burst-shift 17 ms).\n3.

At their joint press conference he stressed Russia’s recent security-guarantee ultimatum, noting that the United States and NATO had ignored Moscow’s key points—none of which, he argued, is unfeasible. He also questioned NATO’s ‘open-door’ policy and recalled that Ukraine’s current leadership was elected on a pledge to resolve the Donbas issue peacefully. Putin expressed hope that Kyiv would eventually do so, yet warned there is no guarantee it will not again try a military scenario.\n\nMacron likewise sees no alternative to the Minsk agreements and will soon visit Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelensky."

But again, we look at actions, not words,’ Blinken said, warning of a decisive allied response to any hostile move."

news.209.d: "Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has rejected any support for the private military company (PMC) 'Wagner' and criticized his compatriots who cooperate with it. He stated this in an interview with Politico. Serbs recruited by the PMC to participate in hostilities in Ukraine will be arrested upon their return home, Vučić promised. He also expressed outrage that the company is, in principle, conducting recruitment in a country friendly to Russia. Serbian Defense Minister Miloš Vučević warned: 'It is absolutely clear to our country that the participation of Serbian citizens in all conflicts in other countries is forbidden, and this entails legal consequences.' Serbian laws prohibit its citizens from participating in armed conflicts abroad. According to the Serbian service of Radio Free Europe, over 30 people in Serbia have been convicted for fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine."

In his speech, he addressed the theme of 'genocide' in Donbas, stating the necessity of protecting the residents of the region, and once again voiced arguments in support of the 'special military operation,' emphasizing its importance for Russia's national interests."
news.341.d: "After fierce and prolonged battles for the southeastern districts of Kursk Oblast, the Armed Forces of Ukraine occupied the city of Obolon. Taking control of this settlement allowed the AFU to cut the strategically important Belgorod-Kursk highway, disrupting the supply of Russian army units. This loss indicates the effective collapse of the front in Russia's border region; however, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation continues to state that the situation is fully under control."
