WGN_mission.2.t: "Assault on Bakhmut"
WGN_mission.2.d: "After the successful capture of Soledar, the Council of Commanders of the Wagner PMC decided to begin the second stage of the "Bakhmut Meat Grinder" operation, which involves the assault and taking control of the city of Bakhmut, or as it is commonly called in the DPR - Artemovsk. Wagner's units will take the city, at the same time turning it into ruins and inflicting huge losses on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, while the Russian Armed Forces will hold the flanks. The Ukrainian command has already begun to take stabilization measures and send reserves from mobilized and experienced units to Artemovsk, preparing for our offensive. Our comrades are facing a serious challenge, but we will fulfill our mission no matter what. An orchestra shall soon play in Bakhmut!"
WGN_mission.2.a: "Understood"

WGN_mission.3.t: "The failure of Operation "Bakhmut Meat Grinder" "
WGN_mission.3.d: "After many days of unsuccessful assaults and shelling of the fortified areas of Artyomovsk, we realized that we had lost our offensive potential in the Bakhmut direction. We inflicted significant damage on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but, unfortunately, we were unable to achieve all the objectives of the operation. The Ukrainians concentrated huge forces near Bakhmut, including tanks, special forces and artillery, so we had practically no opportunity to defeat Bandera’s followers. Evgeniy Viktorovich spoke about this in his press service and accused the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces of not providing adequate support to the Wagner group, which led to the failure of the Bakhmut Meat Grinder operation. This was a big blow to our reputation, but we continue to be the most combat-ready unit in the Northern Military District zone. We still have everything ahead."

Reports from the frontlines highlight the stubborn resolve of Ukrainian forces, revealing miscalculations in their determination. Battles rage, consuming valuable time and resources as the deadline nears. This failure prompts strategy recalibration, a reevaluation of strengths, and the need for a new approach. Amidst discussions in the Kremlin, the fate of the Motherland's ambitions hangs in the balance. Will this setback delay victory or lead to greater challenges? Russian resilience will shape the outcome. History is written in adversity's crucible. As days unfold, the world watches, wondering if the Motherland can rise stronger from this stumble.

DPR.2.desc: "It became known about the death of colonel Vladimir Artemovich Zhogi, commander of a separate intelligence battalion "Sparta". Vladimir has been with us from very beginning of our struggle for the liberation of Donbass. He managed to take part in the battles for Donetsk airport, Slavyansk, Shakhtersk and Snazhny, received many wounds, but even then he always showed himself as a real fighter, able to protect his comrades and return to the ranks again. After the start of the war with Kiev regime, Zhoga was one of the foremost fighters of our army. But the vile Nazis shot him near Volnovakha, at a time when he was evacuating civilians. The farewell to the deceased hero of Donbass is planned to be held at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theater. The Russian leadership also promised to reward Vladimir deservedly as a true defender of the Russian world."

Igor Ivanovich led our troops from the beginning of the fight against the Kiev neo-Nazi regime, and repeatedly proved his dedication to the idea of the liberation of Donbass in battles. But after the end of his tenure as Minister of Defence of the Donetsk People's Republic, he left the country. Although he was living in Moscow, he had repeatedly criticised the current military capabilities of the DPR and LPR, and Russia's policy towards Ukraine. Although Girkin is a veteran and a very experienced commander, he is primarily a traitor to his homeland, who has not returned to Donbass for 8 years and lives quietly in Russia. So what do we do with him?"

Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between the troops took place until 2022. On the one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to get an industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as protect the Russians living in the Republics.

It is reported about 19 dead (including the attacker) and 23 wounded. The shooter himself, 34-year-old Artem Kazantsev, committed suicide before the police arrived.\n Every year there are more and more similar cases, and this trend is starting to scare.

They have all been waiting for this moment since 1991, and now it has finally arrived.

While in the LDPR the idea of reunification with Russia was enthusiastically received, in other territories the local population did not show much enthusiasm for this. Apparently, Bandera’s followers managed to brainwash people more effectively than we expected. We have no choice but to falsify the results of the referendum. We hope that in the near future the locals will understand that they have a future only with Russia, and not with the Kiev Nazis."

After a direct hit, a fire started on the cruiser, which caused the detonation of the ammunition. We had no chance to prevent the flooding.

But if they strike in the opposite direction it is dangerous - the left will not like us repressing our socialist past. And the idea of “common Russian patriotism” can either turn us all away, or, on the contrary, become something that will unite the Russian people in the current turbulent times.

Hour after hour, the commanders of the armored columns reported on the capture of more and more settlements, going deeper into enemy territory. It seemed that columns of armored vehicles would occupy the main cities of Ukraine without firing a shot within just a few days. But in the end, all this turned out to be just an illusion. Receiving resistance from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our equipment got into a jam and was one by one destroyed, unable to retreat in an organized manner.

nato.3.t: "Negotiations with the Russian Federation"
nato.3.d: "It is obvious that the threat from the East in the face of Russia has not disappeared anywhere, and the threat of dictatorship is looming again in Eastern Europe, perhaps even more insidious than the threat of communism many years ago. The Russian Federation is pulling its armed forces to the border with Ukraine, probably preparing for an invasion. Against this background, Putin demanded from us "security guarantees" for the Russian Federation, that is, a complete rejection of our military bases in Eastern Europe, as well as a ban on Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO. Of course, most of Russia's demands are unacceptable, but maybe we need to make some concessions in order to preserve peace in Europe?"

Citizens are dissatisfied with the ongoing political, military and economic crisis, but this was not the only reason for the protests. According to our data, the agents of the Russian special services sent specially warm up local more or less pro-Russian Ukrainians. Bribes, sabotage and operations under a false flag - all this is not one article of the actions of these "saboteurs”. The discontent of the population has not yet reached a critical point. But if you close your eyes to this, then not only the LDPR will soon be under Russia's control. "

Over the years, we have managed to nullify the conflict in the east of our country, establish cooperation with Western countries and even make some compromises with Putin. But now, more than ever, it is impossible to predict the actions of Russia and its regime."

It is unclear only how the intervention takes place. Where will Putin's army strike and will war be declared, what will happen to the separatists in the Donbas… All that remains for our leadership and the country is only to prepare. We must defend our independence and freedom."

They can be led by the nose, subordinate their economies to cheap oil from the Russian Federation, but they will never stay away from Ukraine. Unlike us, Putin has no real allies, and no one will help him in the future confrontation. Victory will be ours, because we are the whole world."

ukr.18.desc: "Today, for the first time in a very long time, black smoke rose over the cities of Ukraine. It is a consequence of an unexpected and massive attack by missiles and drones, carried out on the eve of the Russian Federation. The targets were both military and civilian infrastructure, mainly allocated for electricity and heat supply - CHP plants, transformers, power lines. The public is also excited by the fact that not a single large settlement on the territory of Ukraine escaped from the attack - the city of Sumy located near the border, as well as the capital Kiev and distant Lviv were hit. The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the population protected by it in confusion and fear - if such attacks continue and are frequent, the energy infrastructure will not have time to recover, which will lead both to the impossibility of proper nutrition of the front, and to the decline of the whole country and society as a whole, as a result of the impossibility of continuing industrial production and the collapse of the highly qualified service sector, the cessation of heating and the supply of light, and as a consequence of all this - to hunger, unemployment, large-scale pestilence and the complete collapse of the unified state administration."

In total, more than 90 corpses have been found at the moment, most of the bodies have traces of violent death. We can use what happened for an information war against Russia.

Against the rules of living together on the continent. Even though European countries dont agree to share their borders by force. For the second day, our cities have been bombed and bombarded. Tank columns and air raids, as similar as possible to what Europe saw long ago during World War II and said "never again," but here it is. It started again in 2022, 75 years after the end of World War II. I'm sure you see it, all of you, all of Europe.....

It appeared as a result of an armed uprising with the support of soldiers from Russia. In 1992, our country declared independence from Moldova, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but volunteers from the Russian Federation arrived in time, who established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. For 2022, our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us protection. Our independence has been recognized by countries that are also unrecognized states, namely Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the NKR. Our leader is V.N. Krasnoselsky - he graduated with honors from a military school in Kharkiv, but he did not want to take the oath to independent Ukraine, so he fled to our republic. Well, we have a lot of work to do to improve the quality of life in Pridnestrovie, and we can only hope that big brother in the person of Russia will help us."

news.49.d: "Since the beginning of October 2021, various media outlets have reported that the Russian Federation may be preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine, which caused a crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, as well as the wariness of Western countries. As a result, this led to a series of diplomatic actions on the part of Russia and Western countries, as well as to initial negotiations, which, however, did not have any significant success. Russia was reluctant to act in the political space, and some of the demands looked like nothing more than an attempt to delay the negotiations, or disrupt them. However, unexpectedly for everyone, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov proposed to convene a summit to discuss the conflict over Ukraine, calling on Western countries to «‎ensure justice» and «‎protect peace.». In response, the United States, Great Britain and Ukraine sent a note of consent to participate in this event, although it was not without speculative statements from both sides of the conflict. Many international and national media dubbed this event as an unexpected detente and the likely end of the crisis, but analysts urge not to rush to conclusions — given Russian rhetoric, as well as the ultimatum of Western countries about some points of Russia's early claims, the summit may have absolutely unpredictable consequences, and it is too early to talk about the end of the crisis."

And the reason for this is the urgent appeal of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of partial mobilization. As Vladimir Putin said in his address, Ukraine has shelled the territories of the LPR, the DPR, as well as the Russian-Ukrainian border, which is why he is forced to prepare "retaliatory measures" by starting partial mobilization and putting all kinds of troops on alert. The Ministry of Defense added that only people with combat experience, volunteers and specialists who have served in military police units are subject to partial mobilization. Judging by the data published by the Government of the Russian Federation, it is planned to put under arms about 100,000 people who will carry out police and security functions."

The republic is inhabited mainly by Chechens, as well as other ethnic groups, including Russians, Georgians and Armenians.\n Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, a representative of the Kadyrov family, who have been in power in the region for more than 20 years, still remains in power in Chechnya. The irremovability of the rulers in the republic has made itself felt, all the state institutions of Chechnya are completely subordinated to Kadyrov personally, and the Kadyrov family itself has its own army of mercenaries. However, the Republic's economy is still completely dependent on the federal center, all cash flows are controlled by the Kremlin, and this whole game of Autonomy on the part of both the head of the Republic and the Russian Federation causes some concern. In addition, Chechnya has a number of problems, including corruption, human rights violations, religious and cultural discrimination.\n It is in this state of affairs that the unstable Chechen Republic approaches an equally unstable period of time. While the clouds are gathering over the CIS, Chechnya still remains a toy in the hands of the Kadyrovs and the Federal Government."

He played a big role in the victory of the federal troops in the Second Chechen War. Becoming the first head of post-war Chechnya, he did a lot to restore peace in the republic. For which he paid with his life. In 2004, Akhmat Kadyrov died as a result of a terrorist attack in Grozny. Chechen terrorists led by Shamil Basayev claimed responsibility for his murder. After the death of his father, Ramzan Kadyrov became the new president of the republic. At the same time, mass hanging of Akhmat's portraits in state and public institutions of Chechnya began, and in 2005 a monument was erected to him on the central square of Grozny.\n Now the "Cult of personality" still remains strong, Ramzan or Akhmat are often depicted on the flags of Chechnya, and the name of Kadyrov's father is worn by Chechen special forces."

Such a foothold in the western part of Ukraine will allow Moscow to launch an offensive against much larger cities in the future, and if Kiev does not take active action, experts suggest, it will not avoid future tragedies."

This played a cruel joke with them when the units that approached Krivoy Rog could not immediately break through the APU defenses on the overflowing Ingulets River. One of the missiles destroyed the dam at the Karachunovsky reservoir, and this gave a serious advantage to the defending Ukrainian soldiers.\nIn the end, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation still managed to break through the lines of the APU.

This allowed the Russian army to immediately take the factory districts of Zaporozhye and force the AFU to withdraw to the western part of the city. Only after massive artillery strikes, most of Zaporozhye was surrendered. At the same time, the center of resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine remained on the island of Khortsia for a long time.\nSurrounded on all sides by the water of the Dnieper and Russian soldiers, the defenders of the city steadfastly restrained any attempts to land on the shore.

The towering structure allowed the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to repel several assaults by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, but after an artillery strike, most of them died. And the pitiful remnants of the defenders of the city surrendered.\nControl over Belgorod-Dniester, according to experts, will allow Moscow to finally consolidate its superiority in the Black Sea.

But after the landing of groups of Russian troops in the port of Odessa, the Ukrainian units were forced to withdraw deep into the city.\nThey did not dare to conduct active hostilities in the area of the AFU port, because it was directly adjacent to the historical center of Odessa - a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore, in the end, the Ukrainian army retreated to the area of the international airport. But even from there, after a while, it was knocked out.\nAccording to some reports, pockets of resistance in Odessa are still preserved in places.

It's only a matter of time, they're getting ready, they're waiting for a convenient hour. We will not allow this to happen.\n  In this regard, in accordance with Article 51 of Part 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council of Russia and in pursuance of the treaties on friendship and mutual assistance with the DPR and LPR ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22 of this year, I decided to conduct a special military operation.\n  Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.\n  I believe in your support, in the invincible strength that our love for the Fatherland gives us.""

news.80.d: "Pro-Russian telegram channels today celebrate the fall of Maryinka under the onslaught of Russian troops. Apparently, the AFU forces had to retreat from the city and occupy more favorable defensive lines to the west of this settlement. After the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fierce clashes between the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of Ukraine took place in the Maryinka area, as a result of which the city was completely destroyed. However, now the city is controlled by the troops of the Russian Federation, who march along Druzhby Avenue, the main street of the city. Probably, Maryinka will become a convenient supply hub for the troops of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the NM of the DPR, and the APU thus lost an important supply point. The government of Ukraine has not officially recognized the withdrawal of troops from the city, however, according to experts, President Zelensky will still have to admit defeat."

After seven days of training, he was sent to the Lugansk region and arrived at the front line on September 2. On September 4, he decided to voluntarily surrender. After the surrender, Nuzhin gave an interview to the Ukrainian journalist and editor of Censor.net Yuri Butusov, saying that he joined the Wagner group only in order to get out of prison and quickly surrender to Ukraine.

According to Amnesty International's investigation, FAB-500 bombs penetrated the roof of the eastern part of the theater and detonated in the auditorium, most likely at the level of the light flooring of the stage. It is believed that the strike was most likely carried out by a Russian multi-role fighter such as a Su-25, Su-30, or Su-34. Deputy Mayor of Mariupol Sergei Orlov said that there were between 1,000 and 1,200 civilians in the theater's basement at the time of the strike.

Their motives and what they want to achieve by this are unclear to us, but one thing is clear - the lack of supplies will increase our losses a huge number of times.

Prigozhin also noted that for these «monsters», the life of an ordinary soldier is cheaper than shells, as well as how Defense Minister Shoigu deceived the president and started a war only to get his rank of marshal and one more star on his uniform.

Yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel of the RF Armed Forces, Vinivitin, opened fire on a vehicle of the Wagner PMC, justifying this with his «personal enmity». Evidence of these egregious acts was published by Evgeney Viktorovich and is spreading across the Internet with astonishing speed.

The hour-long session discussed problems with training, equipment, and organization within the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Prigozhin also noted that Russia can only now, as a result of the «Lessons of War» in Ukraine, be called a combat-ready country, even then with a stretch. Additionally, the head of the Wagner PMC spoke about Shoigu and his son-in-law Stolyarov, who now lives in Dubai. Sharp statements by Prigozhin once again raised a fuss on the Internet, dividing Russian patriots into two camps. But in any case, everyone still understands that the truth is on our side, and as long as such creatures as Shoigu and Gerasimov sit in the top military leadership of Russia, we will not achieve total victory."

Even though the bodies have not yet been identified, we can already say with confidence that, to our most profound regret, Dima and Zhenya have passed away.

Meanwhile, the war continues. Today, after an unsuccessful assault, a group of our mercenaries suffered significant losses, which could have been possible to reduce them by five or even more times if we had been given the standard inflow of ammunition. Prigozhin, who had to see with his own eyes the mountain of dead «Musicians», flew into a rage and decided to express himself emotionally by filming it.

In the Russian-occupied territories, brutal treatment of civilians has been observed more than once. The actions of the occupiers were recorded on video cameras, smartphones and audio devices.

Then suddenly the eleventh Russian soldier appears and opens fire on the Ukrainians. In the second video, all eleven soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces are dead. When the fact of the incident was revealed, the Russians immediately accused us of a war crime against prisoners of war. Our soldiers are not at all to blame in this situation, since those killed resisted and «falsely surrendered». Well, since false surrender is not covered by the rules of the Geneva Convention, the shooting of Russian military personnel was completely justified."

The bomb shelter under the building was mostly intact and about 130 people were rescued from it. The exact number of deaths has not been established, but estimates vary from 200 to 600 who died under the rubble.

It is unknown when and who filmed these videos, but this is definitely a war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law. At the time of the murder, our soldiers were lying without weapons, with their arms outstretched or behind their heads, which makes them prisoners of war or non-combatants, which means there was no need to shoot them."
