This is a key step that can ensure the successful implementation of the surrounding operation and give an advantage on the battlefield. That is why the capture Soledara is so important."

The Ukrainians concentrated under Bakhmut had huge forces, including tanks, special forces and artillery, so we had practically no opportunity to defeat Bandera’s followers. Evgeniy Viktorovich spoke about this in his press service and accused the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces of not providing adequate support to the group 'Wagner', which led to the failure of the Bakhmut Meat Grinder operation.

Hour after hour, commanders of armored columns reported on the capture of more and more settlements , going deeper into enemy territory. It seemed that columns of armored vehicles would occupy the main cities of Ukraine without a single shot within just a few days. But in the end, all this turned out to be just an illusion. Receiving repulse from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our equipment fell into a jam and was one by one destroyed, unable to retreat in an orderly manner.
