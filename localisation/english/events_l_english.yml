On 18 January 2022, at a briefing for foreign military attachés, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated that the goals of the exercises are to carry out an unscheduled inspection of the troops and to practise various options for joint actions within the Union State. An important part of the exercises is also an assessment of the transport infrastructure’s capability to ensure the movement of troops during the redeployment of Russian units to Belarusian territory. As part of the drills, twelve Su-35 aircraft, as well as Su-25SM aircraft, two battalions of S-400 air-defence systems, and a battalion of Pantsir-S gun-missile air-defence complexes were transferred there.\nThe exercises will be held for ten days.

On 18 January 2022, at a briefing for foreign military attachés, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated that the goals of the drills are to carry out an unscheduled inspection of the troops and to rehearse various options for joint action within the Union State.

His mood was uncertain. On the one hand, exercises within the Union State were routine events that strengthened the friendship between the peoples of Russia and Belarus and further improved relations with the Russian government, which were already good. But Lukashenko understood that something very bad was looming…\nThe switchboard rang—quite unexpectedly at such a late hour.\n— Yes, yes, I’m listening.\n— Alexander Grigoryevich, you have a call from the Kremlin, directly from Vladimir Putin.\n— Put him through…\nA call from the Kremlin? Such calls are rare.\n— Vladimir Vladimirovich, good evening. What is the reason for such a late call?\n— Good evening to you as well, Alexander Grigoryich. I have a serious matter to discuss."

smo.5.desc: "The exercises are drawing to a close. During them many shells and cartridges were expended, and some equipment broke down—after all, there is no equipment that never fails, nor is there ever likely to be. But all of this can be replenished: factories will produce more shells, and the equipment will be repaired. Most importantly, these drills have strengthened the bond between our fraternal countries and peoples, increased the army’s professionalism, and prepared it for future hardships…\nAdmit it, it sounds as if everything is fine and this is a happy ending, doesn’t it? Ah, if only that were so.\nThe exercises are over, journalists depart for other places in search of new stories, troops are transferred back to their barracks, returning to their usual stations.

smo.11.b: "We keep pressing our line"

smo.12.t: "Premiere of “Best in Hell”"
smo.12.d: "At a moment critical for the Motherland, director Andrey Batov releases the patriotic film “Best in Hell”. The picture tells how the “whites” carry out an assault operation to seize buildings; their task is to take an observation post and direct strike aviation onto targets in the enemy’s rear. Opposing them are the “yellows”, who have entrenched themselves in these buildings and are likewise ready to fight to the end. Although the national identity of the “whites” and “yellows”, the year, and the place of battle are not specified, it is obvious that the “whites” represent Wagner PMC, while the “yellows” depict the AFU. Wagner patron Yevgeny Prigozhin personally contributed to producing the film, and the screenplay was written by Aleksei Nagin, one of the “Orchestra’s” commanders."
smo.12.a: "Not bad"

smo.24.t: "Premiere of “The Witness”"
smo.24.d: "The premiere of the film “The Witness”, which directly addresses the events of the Special Military Operation, took place in Moscow. According to the plot, a Belgian virtuoso violinist and his manager arrive in Moscow for a music competition at the end of February 2022, where they meet a Ukrainian oligarch and, at his invitation, end up in Kyiv—after which a full-scale war begins. The violinist becomes stranded in the village of Semidveri and witnesses the inhuman crimes of Ukrainian neo-Nazis from the Azov Regiment. His main goal now is not just to survive, but to bring the truth to the whole world—for truth is stronger than fear."

According to several outlets, the cruiser Moskva and the patrol ship Vasily Bykov entered the island’s waters and demanded that the local garrison lay down its arms; they received a crude refusal laced with obscenities. The island was then shelled and seized by Russian troops, but the fate of the Ukrainian border guards remains unclear. Ukrainian officials said that 13 border guards were killed after refusing to surrender. The next day, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that all the guards on Snake Island had died and would be posthumously named Heroes of Ukraine. Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet for Logistics Mikhail Yasnikov disputed this, claiming that all 82 Ukrainian servicemen from the island were taken to Sevastopol alive. Britain’s Ministry of Defence believes that if Russia consolidates its grip on the island and places air-defence systems, coastal batteries and cruise missiles there, its forces could dominate the north-western Black Sea. In the event of an amphibious assault on Ukraine’s coast, the island could serve as a staging area, a fire-support site and a radar base."

This led to a series of diplomatic moves by both sides and to preliminary negotiations that achieved no real success. Some Russian demands looked like attempts merely to stall or derail talks. Yet, unexpectedly, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov proposed convening a summit on the conflict, urging Western states to “ensure justice” and “protect peace.” The USA, the UK and Ukraine agreed to take part—though not without hard-edged statements on both sides. The press dubbed the move an unexpected détente and a likely end to the crisis, but analysts warn that, given Russian rhetoric and Western ultimatums, the summit’s outcome is impossible to predict and it is far too soon to speak of a resolution."

The army could not quell the revolt, Tokayev resigned, and the new government pivoted toward the West. Ultimately Kazakhstan announced its withdrawal from the CSTO. Russian propagandists raged—some even called for “denazifying” Kazakhstan—while Russian officials kept silent."

This means the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic has joined the Russia-Ukraine war. Fringe voices had long urged the PMR to fight, but no one took them seriously—until now.

What began as anger over rising gas prices soon took on a political character. Protesters stormed akimats, police stations and Almaty airport. Reports tell of riots, arson, firearms use and looting on both sides.\n\nBy 5 January, hundreds were injured in Almaty alone. Authorities reported dozens of dead security officers, including 13 police killed—one allegedly beheaded. Protesters also suffered heavy losses; unofficial figures cite at least 30–50 dead, hundreds wounded and dozens missing.\n\nIn an emergency address, President Tokayev declared a state of emergency and removed former president Nursultan Nazarbayev from the Security Council, signalling an elite split."

After consulting key officials and the heads of the security and intelligence agencies, Putin addressed the nation, announcing the decision to recognize the independence of the DPR and LPR, and a few hours later signed the relevant decrees and treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with the republics’ leaders, who had arrived in Moscow.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres, along with a number of Western countries and international organizations, condemned Russia’s decision. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the move could be interpreted as a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and a rejection of Russia’s obligations under the Minsk agreements.\n\nMoscow’s decision was supported by Syria, the DPRK, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, the unrecognized states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the leadership of the Ansar Allah movement (the Yemeni Houthis)."

The first information on their columns arriving along the M-4 “Don” highway from Luhansk Oblast appeared in the morning. From the captured headquarters of Russia’s Southern Military District—vital for planning operations in Ukraine—Yevgeny Prigozhin addressed Russians once again:\n\n“Military facilities in Rostov, including the airfield, are under control. Aircraft bound for combat missions are departing normally, no problems. Med-evac flights are leaving, no problems. Everything we are doing is to keep strike aviation from hitting us and instead strike the Ukrainians.\n\nWhen we came here we confirmed many new facts. Huge amounts of territory have been lost. The number of dead soldiers is three to four times higher than the figures ‘reported upstairs’, and what is reported is ten times lower than what is on television. There are no shells, no command. The Chief of the General Staff fled as soon as he learned we were approaching the building.”\n\nPrigozhin also held talks with Deputy Defence Minister Yevkurov and GRU Deputy Chief Alekseyev, who were in the HQ, firmly demanding that Wagner be given the Chief of the General Staff and Shoigu."

The mercenaries are 185 km from Voronezh. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin answered President Putin’s address, refusing to surrender:\n\n“About ‘treason to the Motherland’—the President is deeply mistaken. We are patriots of our Motherland; all Wagner fighters have fought and are fighting. No one will turn himself in just because the President, the FSB or anyone else demands it.

Because we marched for justice.\n\nThey struck us—first artillery, then helicopters. And we advanced without firing a shot, we did not touch a single conscript. We killed no one on the way. Aircraft, helicopters, planes worked against us—we reached Rostov. Without a single shot we seized the HQ building. We hindered no one’s work.\n\nPeople stand in the streets waving Wagner flags.

Prigozhin confirmed ownership:\n\n“Media report that a Gazelle full of money was found at Prigozhin’s office. They found not one Gazelle but a Gazelle and two minibuses packed with money for payroll, ‘Cargo 200’ compensation and other needs.

A beneficial solution with security guarantees for the PMC’s fighters has been approved.\n\nPrigozhin himself confirmed the halt in an audio message:\n“Wagner PMC was about to be disbanded. We set out on a ‘march for justice’. In 24 hours we advanced to within 200 km of Moscow. During this time we did not spill a single drop of our fighters’ blood. Now the moment has come when blood may be shed. Therefore, understanding the responsibility for potential Russian bloodshed on either side, we are turning our columns around and heading back to our field camps as planned.”\n\nWagner forces have left the Southern Military District HQ and other key sites in Rostov-on-Don.

In response we have faced either cynical deception and lies, or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while NATO, despite our protests and concerns, continues to expand inexorably.\n The entire course of events and analysis of incoming information show that a clash between Russia and these forces is inevitable. It is only a matter of time—they are preparing, waiting for the right moment. We will not allow that.\n Therefore, in accordance with Article 51, Section 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council of Russia, and in execution of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the DPR and LPR ratified by the Federal Assembly on 22 February, I have decided to conduct a special military operation.\n Its goal is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kyiv regime. To that end we will strive to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine.\n I believe in your support, in that invincible strength given to us by our love for the Motherland.”"

After the defeat of Ukrainian units in northern Ukraine, remnants of the Ukrainian army poured into Lviv. Together with local militias and the National Police, they established deep defensive lines, leading to a prolonged siege. Incoming reports indicate that Russian artillery destroyed the entire northern industrial district and the historic city center. Ultimately, heavy losses forced Ukrainian defenders to withdraw. Experts note that losing Lviv—a vital corridor linking Western countries with all of Ukraine—will cut off arms shipments to Ukrainian forces and likely lead to Kyiv’s capitulation to Moscow."

Yet well-coordinated Russian assaults and systematic artillery barrages allowed them to storm the city center and push Ukrainian forces back toward the international airport. On-site journalists report extensive urban damage and heavy civilian casualties, particularly among refugees who had arrived from eastern Ukraine in recent months.

Chernivtsi—renowned for its rich history—has witnessed the fall of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, the Romanian Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Now its end has come under Ukraine’s flag. Ukrainian defenders long held off Russian attacks using the Prut River and the Carpathians as natural barriers, but after a massive artillery preparation, Russian units entered the devastated city.

Multiple failed Ukrainian counterattacks left the central districts under siege, and relentless artillery bombardment eventually forced the exhausted defenders to surrender.

Analysts report that Ukrainian units hurriedly redeployed from Donbas hastily prepared the city’s defense, allowing Russian troops to seize the industrial districts and push Ukrainian forces into western Zaporizhzhia. After massive artillery bombardments, most of the city surrendered. A final pocket of resistance held out on Khortytsia Island—surrounded by the Dnipro River and Russian soldiers—before exhaustion, casualties, and a final assault forced the remaining defenders to capitulate."

Infantry units—supported by naval landing craft—stormed the city’s south and quickly secured its historic center. Disorganized Ukrainian detachments attempted to regroup and push back, but were gradually isolated and defeated. The last defenders holed up in the Akkerman Fortress; after withstanding several assaults, a Russian artillery strike decimated them and the survivors surrendered.

Ukrainian troops initially held narrow land corridors near Zhovakhova Hora and the Dry Liman, but after a Russian naval landing in the port, they withdrew to the city’s interior. Fearing damage to UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ukraine avoided direct combat in the historic center and eventually fell back to the international airport—before being driven out. Pockets of resistance reportedly remain, but Russian blockades have sunk most Ukrainian naval vessels in Odessa Harbor, effectively neutralizing Ukraine’s Black Sea fleet. Analysts agree that Russia’s seizure of Odessa secures its maritime dominance and severs Ukraine’s crucial sea lifeline."

After weeks of house-to-house fighting, Mariupol lay in ruins: up to 90% of buildings destroyed. Numerous war crimes are alleged—attacks on a maternity hospital, city hospital, and the drama theater, where hundreds of civilians remained. Both sides blame each other.

This regional center in northeastern Ukraine sits right on the border and defends the routes to Kyiv, Poltava, and Kharkiv, stretching Russian supply lines thin. Over several days, Russian troops encircled Sumy and relentlessly targeted Ukrainian positions with air and artillery strikes. Despite Sumy’s natural defenses—lakes and the Psel River—Ukrainian defenders held out for a long time. A humanitarian crisis unfolded as hundreds of refugees fled each day, and residents endured intermittent power and water cuts as food stocks dwindled. Ultimately, facing threats of total destruction, Ukrainian soldiers were forced to surrender, leaving Sumy completely under Moscow’s control."

news.777.t: "Zelensky Launches Criminal Proceedings Against Poroshenko"
news.777.d: "Ukraine’s political scene is shaken by an unprecedented development: President Volodymyr Zelensky has approved the initiation of criminal proceedings against Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko. According to law enforcement officials, the former head of state is accused of abuse of power, corruption schemes, and possible treason.\nThe Presidential Office insists that the investigation is conducted strictly within the law and is not politically motivated. Poroshenko’s supporters, however, claim this is nothing more than Zelensky’s attempt to eliminate one of the main opposition leaders.\n“We are witnessing a dictator’s effort to clear the political field,” declared one of Poroshenko’s allies, warning that the trial could become a “political spectacle.”\nThe international community is watching closely. EU and US representatives have already voiced concern, cautioning Kyiv about potential repercussions if the case proves to be politically driven. Poroshenko himself responded sharply: “This is not an attack on me, but on Ukrainian democracy.” Meanwhile, his legal team is preparing a courtroom defense as Ukraine’s political elite holds its breath for Zelensky’s next move."

news.778.d: "In recent weeks, rumors have swirled that Volodymyr Zelensky intends to pressure Petro Poroshenko into leaving the country by offering him a so-called “honorable” exile in exchange for dropping the criminal charges.\nAccording to insider sources within the Ukrainian government, various scenarios are under discussion: a diplomatic post abroad, a voluntary departure under the guise of “medical treatment” or “family reasons,” and other options.\nAlthough no official statements have been made, close associates of the ex-president report that he has already received “off-the-record offers” from government representatives. Poroshenko, however, appears determined to stay.\n“I’m not going anywhere. This is my land, and I will remain here no matter what,” he declared at a recent rally in Kyiv.\nWorld leaders and human rights organizations have already expressed concern about potential pressure on the opposition. EU and US officials warn that any forced exile of political figures could undermine Ukraine’s democratic development.\nThe situation continues to escalate: will Zelensky push this tactic to the end, or will Poroshenko withstand the pressure and remain in Ukraine?

news.779.d: "Ukraine’s political landscape is once again rocked by scandal: President Volodymyr Zelensky has green-lit an investigation into former Prime Minister and Batkivshchyna party leader Yulia Tymoshenko.\nLaw enforcement sources say the case centers on alleged corruption linked to gas contracts signed during her premiership, as well as possible illicit funding of her political activities in recent years.\nThe very order to open a criminal probe has provoked an outcry across the political spectrum. Tymoshenko’s allies call it an attempt to eliminate one of the last strong opposition figures, and her supporters have taken to the streets chanting “Hands off Yulia!”\n“This is revenge for my political stance, for fighting for Ukrainians’ rights!” Tymoshenko declared at an emergency press conference. She added that she has no intention of leaving the country and will fight for justice.\nThe international community has weighed in: Brussels and Washington say they are watching closely, warning that politically motivated prosecutions could harm Ukraine’s relations with the West.\nWhether the case will go to trial or fade as another chapter in Ukraine’s political battles remains to be seen."

Insiders report that the former prime minister has been offered an “honorary departure” from Ukraine in exchange for dropping the criminal cases and ceasing political pressure.\nProposed scenarios include diplomatic appointments abroad, medical leave arrangements, or positions within international organizations. Tymoshenko has thus far rejected all such hints of exile.\n“I’m not going anywhere! I survived Yanukovych’s prisons—and I won’t break now!” she told journalists in a recent interview.\nAt the same time, her allies warn that pressure on her may intensify, potentially using legal proceedings as a tool to neutralize her before the next elections.\nUkraine’s Western partners have already voiced unease, suggesting such moves could damage the country’s democratic progress.\nThe key question remains: will Zelensky press ahead to the finish, or will back-channel negotiations bring this confrontation to a softer close?"

holy_news.1.t: "Pope Francis Has Died!"
holy_news.1.d: "Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88 in his residence in the Vatican.\nHis pontificate witnessed the bloodiest conflict of the 21st century—the Russian invasion of Ukraine—which in its duration, death toll, and brutality was often compared to World War II. Although Francis tried to support Ukraine as a victim of aggression, he frequently sparked controversy by seeking to justify Russia, provoking outrage and disappointment among millions of his faithful in Ukraine.\nUnder Pope Francis’s leadership, the Catholic Church underwent a series of fundamental changes, and he remarkably maintained popularity even among significantly more conservative believers. He was the first pontiff born in the New World, in the Southern Hemisphere, and outside Catholic Europe. It has been over a thousand years since Pope Gregory III—a native of Syria—that the Holy See was led by anyone other than a European."

The new Pope is 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the first pontiff in history with U.S. citizenship. He was not seen as a front-runner, made no grand pronouncements, and kept a low profile—but he managed to gather support from cardinals across different camps. He was chosen after the two favorites—a close aide to Francis and the conservative bloc leader—failed to secure enough votes. The new Pope has taken the symbolic name Leo XIV and promises to focus on social issues: poverty, inequality, and workers’ rights in the age of artificial intelligence."
