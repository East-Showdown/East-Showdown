smo.1.t: "NATO Expansion"
smo.1.desc: "It has long been clear that Ukraine aspires to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — an alliance that since its inception has served as a tool of military and political pressure by the West on countries outside its membership. For Russia, NATO’s expansion toward its borders represents a direct threat to national security and strategic interests.\n\nUkraine’s inclusion in NATO would give the West broad opportunities to deploy military infrastructure and weapons in close proximity to Russian borders. This would create a serious regional imbalance and threaten the stability built over decades since the end of the Cold War.\n\nSuch a development is unacceptable for Russia. We cannot allow Ukraine’s territory to be turned into a bridgehead aimed against our country. The time has come to take firm measures to protect Russia’s interests, as well as the interests of its citizens and sovereignty."
smo.1.a: "So, what are we waiting for?"

smo.2.t: "Escalation"
smo.2.desc: "When Vladimir Zelensky came to power in 2019, many hoped for a new stage of peaceful conflict resolution in Ukraine. At the same year, the Normandy Four met in Paris to discuss implementing the Minsk agreements and ending hostilities. However, shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian side abandoned several key peace initiatives, complicating the process and prolonging the conflict.\n\nTo this day, the situation in Ukraine remains a hybrid war — there are no large-scale active hostilities, but provocations, shelling, and local clashes supported by Kyiv continue. In mid-December, Russia demanded NATO stop its eastward expansion policy and provide security guarantees that exclude the deployment of military facilities near Russian borders. These legitimate and justified demands were rejected by the alliance as “unfeasible.”\n\nWe have no choice left. An inevitable escalation of the conflict is approaching — a forced response to ongoing threats and the West’s refusal to consider Russia’s position. Under these circumstances, we are ready to defend our national interests by all available means."
smo.2.a: "We didn’t start this, but we will finish it."


smo.3.t: "Allied Resolve — 2022"

On January 18, 2022, at a briefing for foreign military attachés, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin announced that the goals of the exercises were to conduct an unscheduled inspection of the troops and to practice various scenarios of joint actions within the framework of the Union State. An important part of the exercises was also to assess the transport infrastructure's capacity to support troop movements during the redeployment of Russian units to Belarus. As part of the exercises, 12 Su-35 aircraft were redeployed there, as well as Su-25SM planes, two S-400 air defense system divisions, and a division of Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missile and gun complexes.\nThe exercises will last 10 days. Geographically, they will cover almost all of Belarus, Kaliningrad, and the Black Sea. The number of troops involved in the exercises has not been disclosed.\n***\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the Kremlin.\n— Are you sure we should start the invasion after the exercises?\n— Absolutely, we can no longer wait.\n— Very well, I will give the troops the appropriate orders.\n— Do it. And put me through to Alexander Grigoryevich."

His mood was unclear. On one hand, the exercises within the Union State were a routine matter, strengthening friendship between the peoples of Russia and Belarus, and improving relations with the Russian government, which, however, were already quite good. But Lukashenko understood that something very bad was coming...\nThe switchboard rang. Quite unexpectedly, it was already late.\n— Yes, yes, I’m listening.\n— Alexander Grigoryevich, you have a call from the Kremlin, directly from Vladimir Putin.\n— Connect me...\nA call from the Kremlin? Calls from there are rare.\n— Vladimir Vladimirovich, good evening. What is the reason for this late call?\n— Good evening to you too, Alexander Grigoryevich, I have a serious matter to discuss with you."

smo.5.desc: "The exercises are coming to an end. Many shells and cartridges were fired during the drills; some equipment broke down—after all, unbreakable equipment does not exist, nor is it likely to ever exist. But all this is replaceable: shells will be produced by factories, equipment repaired. Most importantly, these exercises strengthened the bond between our brotherly countries and peoples, increased the army’s professionalism, and prepared it for future challenges...\nYou might agree that it sounds like everything is fine and this is a happy ending? Ah, if only that were true.\nThe exercises are over, journalists leave for other places in search of new news materials, the troops return to barracks and move back to their usual deployment sites.

The story depicts 'white' units conducting an assault operation to capture buildings, with the mission to take an observation post and direct attack aviation against targets in the enemy’s rear. They are opposed by 'yellow' units entrenched in these buildings and ready to fight to the end. Although the nationalities of the 'whites' and 'yellows,' as well as the year and place of the battles, are not specified in the film, it is obvious that the 'whites' represent the Wagner PMC, and the 'yellows' the AFU. The film’s production was supported by Wagner’s patron Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the screenplay was written by Alexey Nagin, one of the commanders of the 'Orchestra.'"

According to the plot, a Belgian violin virtuoso and his manager arrive in Moscow for a music competition in late February 2022, where they meet a Ukrainian oligarch and, at his invitation, find themselves in Kyiv — after which the full-scale war begins. The violinist gets stuck in the village of Semidveri and becomes a witness to the inhuman crimes committed by Ukrainian neo-Nazis from the 'Azov' regiment. His main goal now is not just to survive, but to bring the truth to the whole world. After all, truth is stronger than fear."

According to several sources, the cruiser 'Moskva' and the patrol ship 'Vasily Bykov' entered the island’s waters and demanded the local garrison to surrender, receiving a rude refusal in obscene language. Subsequently, the island was shelled and taken by Russian forces, but the fate of the Ukrainian border guards remains unclear. Ukrainian authorities claim that 13 border guards were killed during the attack after refusing to surrender. The next day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that all border guards on Snake Island had died and would be posthumously awarded the title of Heroes of Ukraine. However, Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet for logistics Mikhail Yasnikov denied this, stating that a group of all 82 Ukrainian servicemen from the island were delivered to Sevastopol. The UK Ministry of Defence believes that if Russia secures Snake Island and deploys air defense, coastal defense, and cruise missiles there, Russian forces could dominate the northwestern part of the Black Sea. Additionally, in the context of a potential amphibious landing on the Ukrainian coast, the island could serve as a foothold, a site for fire support, and a radar base."

As Vladimir Putin stated in his speech, Ukraine shelled the territories of the LPR, DPR, as well as the Russia-Ukraine border, forcing him to prepare ‘retaliatory measures’ by starting partial mobilization and putting all branches of the military on combat alert.

Crowds of protesters seized akimats (local government offices), police stations, and Almaty airport. Reports indicate widespread looting, arson, use of firearms, and marauding on both sides.\n\nAs of January 5, the number of casualties in Almaty alone is in the hundreds. Authorities reported dozens of dead security personnel, including 13 officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, one of whom was, according to officials, beheaded. Protesters also suffered heavy losses, though exact figures are not provided; unofficial data suggests at least 30–50 deaths, hundreds wounded, and dozens missing.\n\nPresident Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in an urgent address to the nation, declared a state of emergency and dismissed Nursultan Nazarbayev — Kazakhstan’s first president who had long maintained de facto control over the country — from the post of head of the Security Council.

From the captured Southern Military District headquarters—an operation planning hub for Russian forces in Ukraine—Yevgeny Prigozhin addressed Russians again:\n‘We now control the military facilities of Rostov, including the airfield. Aircraft departing for combat missions are operating normally, no issues. Medical evacuation flights are going out, no problems. Everything we’re doing is about taking control so that attack aviation strikes Ukrainians rather than us.\nWhen we arrived here, we confirmed many new things. A huge amount of territory is lost. The number of killed soldiers is three to four times higher than what’s reported up the chain. And what is reported is ten times less than what you hear on television. There’s no ammunition, no command. The Chief of the General Staff fled as soon as he learned we were approaching the building.’\n\nPrigozhin also negotiated with Deputy Defense Minister Evkurov and GRU Deputy Chief Alekseyev, both present at the headquarters, where he firmly stated: Wagner demands custody of the Chief of the General Staff and Shoigu."

Incoming reports indicate that Russian artillery destroyed the entire northern industrial district and the historic city center. Ultimately, heavy losses forced Ukrainian defenders to withdraw.

Despite fierce resistance, repeated assaults by Russian storm groups forced Ukrainian defenders to withdraw beyond the city limits. Analysts warn Zhytomyr’s loss will trigger a breakthrough of Russian forces into western Ukraine unless Kyiv mounts an immediate counteroffensive."

Ukrainian defenses were arrayed around its perimeter and along the Southern Bug River. According to some sources, only with Wagner PMC support did Russian units breach eastern districts and secure half the city. The western districts, held by Ukrainian regulars and police, withdrew after heavy fighting and envelopment. Footage shows a massive crater in the central square and widespread damage.

Fierce Ukrainian resistance along the Dnipro’s banks was quickly shattered by advanced Russian units. Ukrainian defenders had hoped to hold northern city sectors, but loss of control over the river crossings doomed their line. Now, streams of refugees move toward Kyiv, water and power are cut off, and heavy damage plagues the city.

Southern apartment districts were leveled by artillery barrages, and Russian infantry advanced block by block. Out of supplies, Ukrainian units destroyed key bridges and withdrew to the Dnipro Metallurgical Plant, where they held out briefly. Eventually, besieged and bearing heavy losses, they were compelled to surrender. Russian military authorities now administer Dnipro, though mass refugees and extensive urban damage pose governance challenges.

Disorganized Ukrainian detachments attempted to regroup and push back, but were gradually isolated and defeated. The last defenders holed up in the Akkerman Fortress; after withstanding several assaults, a Russian artillery strike decimated them and the survivors surrendered.

Ukrainian troops initially held narrow land corridors near Zhovakhova Hora and the Dry Liman, but after a Russian naval landing in the port, they withdrew to the city’s interior. Fearing damage to UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ukraine avoided direct combat in the historic center and eventually fell back to the international airport—before being driven out. Pockets of resistance reportedly remain, but Russian blockades have sunk most Ukrainian naval vessels in Odessa Harbor, effectively neutralizing Ukraine’s Black Sea fleet.

Over several days, Russian troops encircled Sumy and relentlessly targeted Ukrainian positions with air and artillery strikes. Despite Sumy’s natural defenses—lakes and the Psel River—Ukrainian defenders held out for a long time. A humanitarian crisis unfolded as hundreds of refugees fled each day, and residents endured intermittent power and water cuts as food stocks dwindled.

The discussion began in a one-on-one format and continued over a working lunch. The Russian president described the conversation as useful and substantive. The results were summarized during a press conference. One of the key issues was Russia’s recent ultimatum on security guarantees in Europe. Putin reminded that the US and NATO ignored the main points of the Russian proposal. Although, he stressed, there is not a single point considered unfeasible in Moscow. The Russian leader also pointed to the questionable policy of NATO’s open-door approach, rejecting Moscow’s key proposal to stop NATO expansion eastward. Putin also recalled that the current Ukrainian leadership ran for elections on the promise of a peaceful resolution of the Donbas issue, expressing hope that this will eventually happen. However, he emphasized there are no guarantees that Kyiv will not attempt a military scenario, as it has done twice before. Macron, who plans to visit Kyiv soon to meet with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, also sees no alternative to the Minsk agreements."

news.194.d: "Today Ukraine faced the most massive attack by Russia since the conflict began. In the early hours, Russian forces launched a barrage of missiles on major Ukrainian cities—including Kyiv, Odesa, Lviv, and Ternopil—aiming at critical infrastructure. The strikes caused widespread power outages, water supply disruptions, and suspended public transport.\n\nIn Kyiv, air-raid sirens sounded early, followed by explosions across multiple districts. One missile hit the city center, causing destruction and panic among residents. Mayor Vitali Klitschko called it the heaviest assault on the capital in months, damaging communal facilities like power stations and heating networks.\n\nIn Lviv, western Ukraine also suffered severe damage to its power grid. The city’s mayor reported blackouts and the closure of schools and universities. Official Ukrainian figures report at least 23 deaths and over 100 injuries.

nato.11.t: "Diplomatic Deadlock with Russia"
nato.11.d: "Negotiations with Russia, which began in late 2021, have reached an impasse. The talks aimed to find a compromise on security and tensions along NATO’s eastern borders, but diplomatic efforts have yielded no concrete results. Russia continues to demand 'security guarantees' and a halt to NATO expansion, especially eastward toward its borders, while the Alliance rejects ultimatums, affirming its right to defend all members and uphold an open-door policy for new entrants.\n\nThe NATO Council meeting took place in a tense atmosphere, as more member states call for a firmer stance toward Moscow. Intelligence reports indicate a buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine’s border, alarming Eastern European nations and sparking discussions about deploying additional NATO troops to the region. There is a risk that further talks could collapse entirely, and the situation may rapidly escalate into a serious conflict in the coming months."
nato.11.a: "Continue diplomatic efforts"

nato.12.t: "NATO–Russia Council"
nato.12.d: "Talks between NATO and Russia have stalled. Despite numerous meetings and statement exchanges, key security issues remain unresolved. Russia still insists on guarantees against new members—particularly Ukraine—joining the Alliance and demands NATO forces withdraw from its eastern fringes. NATO, in turn, refuses to concede, viewing such demands as violations of its principles and commitments to allies.\n\nIn response to escalating tensions, NATO has proposed an emergency meeting of the NATO–Russia Council. This format, designed to address urgent issues and prevent further escalation, may represent the last chance for a diplomatic solution. However, Allies are divided on strategy: some urge firmness in negotiations, while others fear that too much rigidity will worsen the situation."

The meeting’s primary goal was to agree on a unified response to the growing threat and discuss measures to strengthen regional security. The atmosphere was anxious but resolute, with ministers debating both long-term defense strategies and urgent steps to prevent further escalation.\n\nSome member states called for bolstering eastern defenses and increasing EU military presence in key areas to demonstrate resolve. Others warned that aggressive actions could backfire and provoke conflict. Coordination with NATO and potential military assistance to partner nations at the EU’s borders were also key topics. The meeting’s outcome may shape Europe’s security posture and the EU’s role amid mounting threats."

The spotlight was on escalating tensions in Eastern Europe. With the strain between Russia and NATO mounting and rumors of potential military escalation circulating, this year’s conference promised to be one of the most consequential in decades.\n\nA palpable tension filled the room. Western delegates reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and security. The Russian delegation, however, insisted on the need for security guarantees and condemned NATO’s eastward expansion as a direct threat.\n\nUkraine’s President delivered a stirring address pledging to defend his country’s territory, earning thunderous applause. Proposals from European and American leaders to impose new sanctions on Russia drew mixed reactions. As talks turned to possible further sanctions, arms deliveries, and diplomatic measures to curb escalation, one question loomed: can diplomacy avert war, or is Europe on the brink of a new conflict?"

Finland’s historic step symbolizes strengthened ties with the West and a commitment to bolster national defense.\n\nThe accession ceremony in Brussels featured Finnish leaders declaring that NATO membership provides a new security guarantee. Allies lauded Finland’s entry, emphasizing that expansion is a response to emerging threats. For NATO, Finland’s membership significantly reinforces the Alliance’s eastern flank by extending the alliance’s border farther north.\n\nRussia’s leadership condemned the move as destabilizing the region’s security balance and hinted at potential countermeasures along the Finland–Russia border. In contrast, European and American officials welcomed Finland’s accession as a key victory for continental security."

Sweden’s accession highlights its commitment to collective defense.\n\nThe signing ceremony at NATO Headquarters in Brussels saw Alliance leaders and Swedish representatives celebrating the deepened partnership. Sweden’s membership provides NATO with strategic access to the Baltic Sea region and further strengthens the eastern flank. Allies regard this expansion as crucial to deterring potential threats and enhancing regional security.\n\nRussia’s officials criticized the move, calling NATO’s expansion a threat to stability in Northern Europe and announcing considerations for increased military deployment in the Baltic region.

news.777.t: "Zelensky Launches Criminal Proceedings Against Poroshenko"
news.777.d: "Ukraine’s political scene is shaken by an unprecedented development: President Volodymyr Zelensky has approved the initiation of criminal proceedings against Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko. According to law enforcement officials, the former head of state is accused of abuse of power, corruption schemes, and possible treason.\nThe Presidential Office insists that the investigation is conducted strictly within the law and is not politically motivated. Poroshenko’s supporters, however, claim this is nothing more than Zelensky’s attempt to eliminate one of the main opposition leaders.\n“We are witnessing a dictator’s effort to clear the political field,” declared one of Poroshenko’s allies, warning that the trial could become a “political spectacle.”\nThe international community is watching closely. EU and US representatives have already voiced concern, cautioning Kyiv about potential repercussions if the case proves to be politically driven. Poroshenko himself responded sharply: “This is not an attack on me, but on Ukrainian democracy.” Meanwhile, his legal team is preparing a courtroom defense as Ukraine’s political elite holds its breath for Zelensky’s next move."

news.778.d: "In recent weeks, rumors have swirled that Volodymyr Zelensky intends to pressure Petro Poroshenko into leaving the country by offering him a so-called “honorable” exile in exchange for dropping the criminal charges.\nAccording to insider sources within the Ukrainian government, various scenarios are under discussion: a diplomatic post abroad, a voluntary departure under the guise of “medical treatment” or “family reasons,” and other options.\nAlthough no official statements have been made, close associates of the ex-president report that he has already received “off-the-record offers” from government representatives. Poroshenko, however, appears determined to stay.\n“I’m not going anywhere. This is my land, and I will remain here no matter what,” he declared at a recent rally in Kyiv.\nWorld leaders and human rights organizations have already expressed concern about potential pressure on the opposition. EU and US officials warn that any forced exile of political figures could undermine Ukraine’s democratic development.\nThe situation continues to escalate: will Zelensky push this tactic to the end, or will Poroshenko withstand the pressure and remain in Ukraine?

news.779.d: "Ukraine’s political landscape is once again rocked by scandal: President Volodymyr Zelensky has green-lit an investigation into former Prime Minister and Batkivshchyna party leader Yulia Tymoshenko.\nLaw enforcement sources say the case centers on alleged corruption linked to gas contracts signed during her premiership, as well as possible illicit funding of her political activities in recent years.\nThe very order to open a criminal probe has provoked an outcry across the political spectrum. Tymoshenko’s allies call it an attempt to eliminate one of the last strong opposition figures, and her supporters have taken to the streets chanting “Hands off Yulia!”\n“This is revenge for my political stance, for fighting for Ukrainians’ rights!” Tymoshenko declared at an emergency press conference. She added that she has no intention of leaving the country and will fight for justice.\nThe international community has weighed in: Brussels and Washington say they are watching closely, warning that politically motivated prosecutions could harm Ukraine’s relations with the West.\nWhether the case will go to trial or fade as another chapter in Ukraine’s political battles remains to be seen."

Insiders report that the former prime minister has been offered an “honorary departure” from Ukraine in exchange for dropping the criminal cases and ceasing political pressure.\nProposed scenarios include diplomatic appointments abroad, medical leave arrangements, or positions within international organizations. Tymoshenko has thus far rejected all such hints of exile.\n“I’m not going anywhere! I survived Yanukovych’s prisons—and I won’t break now!” she told journalists in a recent interview.\nAt the same time, her allies warn that pressure on her may intensify, potentially using legal proceedings as a tool to neutralize her before the next elections.\nUkraine’s Western partners have already voiced unease, suggesting such moves could damage the country’s democratic progress.\nThe key question remains: will Zelensky press ahead to the finish, or will back-channel negotiations bring this confrontation to a softer close?"

holy_news.1.t: "Pope Francis Has Died!"
holy_news.1.d: "Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88 in his residence in the Vatican.\nHis pontificate witnessed the bloodiest conflict of the 21st century—the Russian invasion of Ukraine—which in its duration, death toll, and brutality was often compared to World War II. Although Francis tried to support Ukraine as a victim of aggression, he frequently sparked controversy by seeking to justify Russia, provoking outrage and disappointment among millions of his faithful in Ukraine.\nUnder Pope Francis’s leadership, the Catholic Church underwent a series of fundamental changes, and he remarkably maintained popularity even among significantly more conservative believers. He was the first pontiff born in the New World, in the Southern Hemisphere, and outside Catholic Europe. It has been over a thousand years since Pope Gregory III—a native of Syria—that the Holy See was led by anyone other than a European."

His work is noted for active involvement in social outreach, ecumenical dialogue, and support for the Ukrainian diaspora, especially during the full-scale war in Ukraine.\nWith Pope Francis’s death, the religious world’s attention turns to the conclave, possibly to be held at the end of 2025. The press is already drawing up shortlists, and the inclusion of a Ukrainian on that list has caused a stir. There has been no official statement from Mykola Bychok or the Vatican yet, but his mention in religious media as a potential candidate indicates the growing influence of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic community on global Church politics."

holy_news.3.d: "The conclave has concluded in the Vatican. After four ballots, the cardinals elected the 267th Pope of Rome. The new Pope is 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the first pontiff in history with U.S. citizenship. He was not seen as a front-runner, made no grand pronouncements, and kept a low profile—but he managed to gather support from cardinals across different camps. He was chosen after the two favorites—a close aide to Francis and the conservative bloc leader—failed to secure enough votes. The new Pope has taken the symbolic name Leo XIV and promises to focus on social issues: poverty, inequality, and workers’ rights in the age of artificial intelligence."
