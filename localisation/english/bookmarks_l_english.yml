 EAST_SHOWDOWN_NAME: "Eastern Crisis"
EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "2022 - Eastern Crisis\n\nThe Eastern Crisis traces its origins back to the end of 2013, when the Euromaidan began in Ukraine. Initially triggered by the halt in signing the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, it took on a national character after November 30 due to the brutal beating of student protesters by law enforcement on Independence Square.\n\nV. Yanukovych, the then President of Ukraine, fled to Russia, leaving behind economic stagnation, a decimated army, a broken Ukraine-EU association agreement, and much more.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia, accustomed to seeing Ukraine within its sphere of influence, watched the situation and tried to exert influence through its people in the government, organizing anti-Maidan protests, bribing thugs, and using various other methods.\n\nHowever, by the end of winter, more and more 'local militias,' also known as 'little green men,' began to appear in Crimea. Ukraine was unstable, a temporary government led by A. Yatsenyuk was formed, and A. Turchynov was appointed as the acting commander-in-chief of the army. In reality, the entire system of power was cracking due to the divide between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian views.\n\nThe peak of the crisis occurred on March 18, 2014, when Russia held a referendum in Crimea, followed by its annexation. Ukraine could do nothing...\n\nAt the same time, pro-Russian rallies were held across Eastern and Southern Ukraine, which were mostly either suppressed by authorities or pro-Ukrainian citizens. Notable incidents occurred in Odessa, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk.\n\nAs Ukraine stabilized the regions, it faced irregular armed forces in the East. On April 12, the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) in Eastern Ukraine was announced. The first key battles erupted in the summer, and by autumn, the Minsk agreements were signed, intended to stop the bloodshed and start a dialogue on returning the self-proclaimed republics to Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, over these eight years, there have been sporadic skirmishes, mostly initiated by the LPR and DPR. On the other hand, the situation stabilized both along the demarcation line and in Ukraine. Over these years, a new president was elected, stability returned, economic development began, the army was rebuilt, reforms were implemented, and much more.\n\nClouds began to gather gradually from 2020, when Russia started amassing troops on the border with Ukraine. As of January 1, 2022, the situation is again descending into darkness. The diplomatic stalemate between the West and Russia only highlights Putin's determination to take matters into his own hands and resolve the Ukrainian issue. But will it happen?"
 UKR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Following the flight of the incumbent president in 2014, on 20 February, Russia sent its troops into Crimea, which was subsequently occupied. In April 2014, protests in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated into an armed conflict in which Russia supported the DPR and LPR.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, fighting was localised in the Donbass and Crimea.\n\nOn 21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LPR, officially sent troops to their territory on 22 February, and on 24 February began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine."

After a year of conflict, the Minsk ceasefire agreements were reached, although there were many skirmishes in the following years.\n\n21 February 2022, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, and on 24 February, together with the republics, began a full-scale invasion of Ukrainian territory."
 BLR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the independence of the Republic of Belarus, the young and ambitious Alexander Lukashenko was elected president. During his rule, he gradually began to build his dictatorship and move closer to Russia. On 6 July 2010, Belarus joined the EAEU customs union and received many discounts on Russian goods. During the 2020 elections, Lukashenko was accused of fraud and large-scale protests began, which were later suppressed.\n/after the Russian-Ukrainian war began, the Republic of Belarus made its territory available to the Russian military and Russian military equipment."
 RUS_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "In 2014, Russian Federation troops entered the territory of the Crimean peninsula, which was controlled by Ukraine. During the occupation, Western sanctions were imposed against Russia, which negatively affected the Russian economy. In April 2014, protests in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated to the stage of armed conflict, during which Russia supported the self-proclaimed DPR and LNR.\n\n21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, officially introduced troops into their territory on 22 February, and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February."
 WGN_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "PMC Wagner is believed to have been established in 2014 by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin and former employee of PMC Slavyansky Korps Dmitry Utkin, who had the call sign "Wagner"." For the first time the activities of the Wagner group became known after reports about mercenaries fighting on the side of separatists in Donbass. The media wrote about the PMC's presence in Syria in 2016 and active participation in the storming of Palmyra, and according to the UN, more than a thousand Wagner fighters have been deployed on the territory of Libya since October 2018. The Wagner Group has also been credited with operations in CAR, Sudan and a host of other African countries. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, PMC Wagner entered the war on Russia's side."
 LPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "On 12 May 2014, during the armed conflict in Donbass, the republics of the DPR and LNR, supported by Russia, declared their independence from Ukraine. A long conflict began, during which Ukraine managed to regain control over part of their territories.

 POL_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Poland is a country in Central Europe with access to the Baltic Sea. Member of the European Union and the NATO bloc. The sixth largest economy in the European Union. At the same time, its wary attitude towards Russia is the result of very tense diplomatic relations, which have steadily deteriorated since Vladimir Putin came to power. This is an important factor in Poland's special attention to the political reorientation of all its eastern neighbours. After Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the Defence of the Fatherland Act, under which the Polish army will be modernised and its strength will be doubled to 300,000 men."
 PMR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic (TMR) is an unrecognised state between Ukraine and Moldova. It emerged as a result of an armed rebellion supported by Russia. In 1992 our country declared independence from Moldavia, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but in time arrived volunteers from the Russian Federation, which established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. As of 2022 our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us defence. After the events of 24 February the DMR was left behind, the question is for how long?"
 CHE_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Chechnya is legally an autonomous sub-unit of the federation, but in reality has a de facto independent internal policy from the centre. Founded on 9 January 1993, Chechnya has always had a special status in Russian domestic politics. However, after the first and second Chechen wars and the rise to power of Putin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya was given a special extra-legal status. As in all regions of the country, after centralisation in Vladimir Putin's first two terms, any economic independence of Chechnya was smashed. In return for Putin's absolute loyalty, Ramzan Kadyrov turned Chechnya into his de facto "Toy" where he is almost a god and can do anything with absolute impunity. This is the situation in which Chechnya has approached February 2022."
