 EAST_SHOWDOWN_NAME: "Eastern Crisis"
EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "2014: The Beginning of Political Instability\n\nIn 2014, relations between Russia and Ukraine entered a phase of serious instability. Political changes in Ukraine, including the Euromaidan movement and the ousting of President Yanukovych, led to an internal crisis and a deep divide within Ukrainian society.\n\nIn response to the events in Kyiv, Russia annexed Crimea, citing the need to protect the Russian-speaking population and its strategic interests. This move triggered sharp international condemnation and became the basis for the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia.\n\nAt the same time, an armed conflict broke out in the eastern regions of Ukraine between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian militias, further complicating the situation in the region.\n\n2014–2022: A Protracted Conflict\n\nAfter the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of hostilities in Donbas, Ukraine became embroiled in a prolonged conflict. Multiple attempts were made to resolve it through the Minsk Agreements, but the implementation of these accords was continually hampered by ceasefire violations and the lack of a lasting compromise between the parties.\n\nDuring this period, Russia faced increasing economic sanctions, while Ukraine moved closer to Western countries, strengthening its cooperation with the EU and the United States and receiving military and economic support from them.\n\n2022: A World on the Brink of War\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the situation reached a peak of tension: the Russian side demanded guarantees for its own security and the protection of the Donbas population from perceived threats. It pointed to the potential further expansion of NATO eastward and the possible deployment of offensive weapons near its borders as major concerns for the Russian leadership.\n\nIn January and February 2022, negotiations were held between Russia and NATO, during which Russia demanded legally binding security guarantees — including a refusal to admit Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries into the North Atlantic Alliance, as well as a ban on the deployment of offensive missile systems and foreign troops near Russian borders.\n\nThe negotiations failed to produce a mutually acceptable outcome: NATO leaders emphasized every nation’s right to choose its own allies and security arrangements, while the Russian side interpreted the lack of compromise as a disregard for its core concerns and a signal for further escalation."
 UKR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Following the flight of the incumbent president in 2014, on 20 February, Russia sent its troops into Crimea, which was subsequently occupied. In April 2014, protests in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated into an armed conflict in which Russia supported the DPR and LPR.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, fighting was localised in the Donbass and Crimea.\n\nOn 21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LPR, officially sent troops to their territory on 22 February, and on 24 February began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine."
 NTO_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "NATO is a military-political bloc uniting most countries. It was founded on 4 April 1949 in the United States, to combat the possible expansion of communism. The founding countries of NATO are the USA, Canada, Iceland, the UK, Portugal, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Italy. One of NATO's stated purposes is to provide deterrence of aggression or defence to NATO members and candidates for membership. At the moment, 30 countries are members of NATO, and 19 other countries participate in the Partnership for Peace programme. Georgia and Ukraine are also considered candidates for NATO membership, while Bosnia and Herzegovina received a membership plan back in December 18.

 DPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "On 12 May 2014, during the armed conflict in Donbass, the republics of the DPR and LNR, backed by Russia, declared their independence from Ukraine. A long conflict began, during which Ukraine managed to regain control over part of their territories. After a year of conflict, the Minsk ceasefire agreements were reached, although there were many skirmishes in the following years.\n\n21 February 2022, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, and on 24 February, together with the republics, began a full-scale invasion of Ukrainian territory."
 BLR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the independence of the Republic of Belarus, the young and ambitious Alexander Lukashenko was elected president. During his rule, he gradually began to build his dictatorship and move closer to Russia. On 6 July 2010, Belarus joined the EAEU customs union and received many discounts on Russian goods. During the 2020 elections, Lukashenko was accused of fraud and large-scale protests began, which were later suppressed.\n/after the Russian-Ukrainian war began, the Republic of Belarus made its territory available to the Russian military and Russian military equipment."
 RUS_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "In 2014, Russian Federation troops entered the territory of the Crimean peninsula, which was controlled by Ukraine. During the occupation, Western sanctions were imposed against Russia, which negatively affected the Russian economy. In April 2014, protests in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated to the stage of armed conflict, during which Russia supported the self-proclaimed DPR and LNR.\n\n21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, officially introduced troops into their territory on 22 February, and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February."
 WGN_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "PMC Wagner is believed to have been established in 2014 by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin and former employee of PMC Slavyansky Korps Dmitry Utkin, who had the call sign "Wagner"." For the first time the activities of the Wagner group became known after reports about mercenaries fighting on the side of separatists in Donbass. The media wrote about the PMC's presence in Syria in 2016 and active participation in the storming of Palmyra, and according to the UN, more than a thousand Wagner fighters have been deployed on the territory of Libya since October 2018. The Wagner Group has also been credited with operations in CAR, Sudan and a host of other African countries. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, PMC Wagner entered the war on Russia's side."
 LPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "On 12 May 2014, during the armed conflict in Donbass, the republics of the DPR and LNR, supported by Russia, declared their independence from Ukraine. A long conflict began, during which Ukraine managed to regain control over part of their territories.

 POL_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Poland is a country in Central Europe with access to the Baltic Sea. Member of the European Union and the NATO bloc. The sixth largest economy in the European Union. At the same time, its wary attitude towards Russia is the result of very tense diplomatic relations, which have steadily deteriorated since Vladimir Putin came to power. This is an important factor in Poland's special attention to the political reorientation of all its eastern neighbours. After Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the Defence of the Fatherland Act, under which the Polish army will be modernised and its strength will be doubled to 300,000 men."
 PMR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic (TMR) is an unrecognised state between Ukraine and Moldova. It emerged as a result of an armed rebellion supported by Russia. In 1992 our country declared independence from Moldavia, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but in time arrived volunteers from the Russian Federation, which established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. As of 2022 our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us defence. After the events of 24 February the DMR was left behind, the question is for how long?"
 CHE_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Chechnya is legally an autonomous sub-unit of the federation, but in reality has a de facto independent internal policy from the centre. Founded on 9 January 1993, Chechnya has always had a special status in Russian domestic politics. However, after the first and second Chechen wars and the rise to power of Putin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya was given a special extra-legal status. As in all regions of the country, after centralisation in Vladimir Putin's first two terms, any economic independence of Chechnya was smashed. In return for Putin's absolute loyalty, Ramzan Kadyrov turned Chechnya into his de facto "Toy" where he is almost a god and can do anything with absolute impunity. This is the situation in which Chechnya has approached February 2022."
