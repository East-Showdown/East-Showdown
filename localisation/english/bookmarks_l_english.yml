 POL_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Poland is a country in Central Europe with access to the Baltic Sea. Member of the European Union and the NATO bloc. The sixth largest economy in the European Union. At the same time, its wary attitude towards Russia is the result of very tense diplomatic relations, which have steadily deteriorated since Vladimir Putin came to power. This is an important factor in Poland's special attention to the political reorientation of all its eastern neighbours. After Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the Defence of the Fatherland Act, under which the Polish army will be modernised and its strength will be doubled to 300,000 men."
 PMR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic (TMR) is an unrecognised state between Ukraine and Moldova. It emerged as a result of an armed rebellion supported by Russia. In 1992 our country declared independence from Moldavia, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but in time arrived volunteers from the Russian Federation, which established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. As of 2022 our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us defence. After the events of 24 February the DMR was left behind, the question is for how long?"
 CHE_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Chechnya is legally an autonomous sub-unit of the federation, but in reality has a de facto independent internal policy from the centre. Founded on 9 January 1993, Chechnya has always had a special status in Russian domestic politics. However, after the first and second Chechen wars and the rise to power of Putin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya was given a special extra-legal status. As in all regions of the country, after centralisation in Vladimir Putin's first two terms, any economic independence of Chechnya was smashed. In return for Putin's absolute loyalty, Ramzan Kadyrov turned Chechnya into his de facto "Toy" where he is almost a god and can do anything with absolute impunity. This is the situation in which Chechnya has approached February 2022."
