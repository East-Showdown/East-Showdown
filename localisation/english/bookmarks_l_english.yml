 EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_NAME: "Eastern Crisis"
EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "2022 - Eastern Crisis\n\nThe Eastern Crisis traces its origins back to the end of 2013, when the Euromaidan began in Ukraine. Initially triggered by the halt in signing the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, it took on a national character after November 30 due to the brutal beating of student protesters by law enforcement on Independence Square.\n\nV. Yanukovych, the then President of Ukraine, fled to Russia, leaving behind economic stagnation, a decimated army, a broken Ukraine-EU association agreement, and much more.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia, accustomed to seeing Ukraine within its sphere of influence, watched the situation and tried to exert influence through its people in the government, organizing anti-Maidan protests, bribing thugs, and using various other methods.\n\nHowever, by the end of winter, more and more 'local militias,' also known as 'little green men,' began to appear in Crimea. Ukraine was unstable, a temporary government led by A. Yatsenyuk was formed, and A. Turchynov was appointed as the acting commander-in-chief of the army. In reality, the entire system of power was cracking due to the divide between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian views.\n\nThe peak of the crisis occurred on March 18, 2014, when Russia held a referendum in Crimea, followed by its annexation. Ukraine could do nothing...\n\nAt the same time, pro-Russian rallies were held across Eastern and Southern Ukraine, which were mostly either suppressed by authorities or pro-Ukrainian citizens. Notable incidents occurred in Odessa, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk.\n\nAs Ukraine stabilized the regions, it faced irregular armed forces in the East. On April 12, the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) in Eastern Ukraine was announced. The first key battles erupted in the summer, and by autumn, the Minsk agreements were signed, intended to stop the bloodshed and start a dialogue on returning the self-proclaimed republics to Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, over these eight years, there have been sporadic skirmishes, mostly initiated by the LPR and DPR. On the other hand, the situation stabilized both along the demarcation line and in Ukraine. Over these years, a new president was elected, stability returned, economic development began, the army was rebuilt, reforms were implemented, and much more.\n\nClouds began to gather gradually from 2020, when Russia started amassing troops on the border with Ukraine. As of January 1, 2022, the situation is again descending into darkness. The diplomatic stalemate between the West and Russia only highlights Putin's determination to take matters into his own hands and resolve the Ukrainian issue. But will it happen?"
 UKR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "Following the flight of the incumbent president in 2014, on 20 February, Russia sent its troops into Crimea, which was subsequently occupied. In April 2014, protests in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated into an armed conflict in which Russia supported the DPR and LPR.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, fighting was localised in the Donbass and Crimea.\n\nOn 21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LPR, officially sent troops to their territory on 22 February, and on 24 February began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine."
 NTO_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "NATO is a military-political bloc uniting most countries. It was founded on 4 April 1949 in the United States, to combat the possible expansion of communism. The founding countries of NATO are the USA, Canada, Iceland, the UK, Portugal, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Italy. One of NATO's stated purposes is to provide deterrence of aggression or defence to NATO members and candidates for membership. At the moment, 30 countries are members of NATO, and 19 other countries participate in the Partnership for Peace programme. Georgia and Ukraine are also considered candidates for NATO membership, while Bosnia and Herzegovina received a membership plan back in December 18. Since 24 February, NATO has been providing various assistance to Ukraine."
 DPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "On 12 May 2014, during the armed conflict in Donbass, the republics of the DPR and LNR, backed by Russia, declared their independence from Ukraine. A long conflict began, during which Ukraine managed to regain control over part of their territories. After a year of conflict, the Minsk ceasefire agreements were reached, although there were many skirmishes in the following years.\n\n21 February 2022, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, and on 24 February, together with the republics, began a full-scale invasion of Ukrainian territory."
 BLR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "After the independence of the Republic of Belarus, the young and ambitious Alexander Lukashenko was elected president. During his rule, he gradually began to build his dictatorship and move closer to Russia. On 6 July 2010, Belarus joined the EAEU customs union and received many discounts on Russian goods. During the 2020 elections, Lukashenko was accused of fraud and large-scale protests began, which were later suppressed.\n/after the Russian-Ukrainian war began, the Republic of Belarus made its territory available to the Russian military and Russian military equipment."
 RUS_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "In 2014, Russian Federation troops entered the territory of the Crimean peninsula, which was controlled by Ukraine. During the occupation, Western sanctions were imposed against Russia, which negatively affected the Russian economy. In April 2014, protests in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions escalated to the stage of armed conflict, during which Russia supported the self-proclaimed DPR and LNR.\n\n21 February, Russia recognised the independence of the DPR and LNR, officially introduced troops into their territory on 22 February, and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February."
 WGN_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "PMC Wagner is believed to have been established in 2014 by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin and former employee of PMC Slavyansky Korps Dmitry Utkin, who had the call sign "Wagner"." For the first time the activities of the Wagner group became known after reports about mercenaries fighting on the side of separatists in Donbass. The media wrote about the PMC's presence in Syria in 2016 and active participation in the storming of Palmyra, and according to the UN, more than a thousand Wagner fighters have been deployed on the territory of Libya since October 2018. The Wagner Group has also been credited with operations in CAR, Sudan and a host of other African countries. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, PMC Wagner entered the war on Russia's side."

 POL_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "Poland is a country in Central Europe with access to the Baltic Sea. Member of the European Union and the NATO bloc. The sixth largest economy in the European Union. At the same time, its wary attitude towards Russia is the result of very tense diplomatic relations, which have steadily deteriorated since Vladimir Putin came to power. This is an important factor in Poland's special attention to the political reorientation of all its eastern neighbours. After Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the Defence of the Fatherland Act, under which the Polish army will be modernised and its strength will be doubled to 300,000 men."
 PMR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "The Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic (TMR) is an unrecognised state between Ukraine and Moldova. It emerged as a result of an armed rebellion supported by Russia. In 1992 our country declared independence from Moldavia, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but in time arrived volunteers from the Russian Federation, which established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. As of 2022 our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us defence. After the events of 24 February the DMR was left behind, the question is for how long?"
 CHE_EAST_SHOWDOWN_2022_01_01_DESC: "Chechnya is legally an autonomous sub-unit of the federation, but in reality has a de facto independent internal policy from the centre. Founded on 9 January 1993, Chechnya has always had a special status in Russian domestic politics. However, after the first and second Chechen wars and the rise to power of Putin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya was given a special extra-legal status. As in all regions of the country, after centralisation in Vladimir Putin's first two terms, any economic independence of Chechnya was smashed. In return for Putin's absolute loyalty, Ramzan Kadyrov turned Chechnya into his de facto "Toy" where he is almost a god and can do anything with absolute impunity. This is the situation in which Chechnya has approached February 2022."

EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "2014: The Beginning of Political Instability\n\nIn 2014, relations between Russia and Ukraine entered a phase of serious instability. Political changes in Ukraine, including the Euromaidan movement and the ousting of President Yanukovych, led to an internal crisis and a deep divide within Ukrainian society.\n\nIn response to the events in Kyiv, Russia annexed Crimea, citing the need to protect the Russian-speaking population and its strategic interests. This move triggered sharp international condemnation and became the basis for the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia.\n\nAt the same time, an armed conflict broke out in the eastern regions of Ukraine between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian militias, further complicating the situation in the region.\n\n2014–2022: A Protracted Conflict\n\nAfter the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of hostilities in Donbas, Ukraine became embroiled in a prolonged conflict. Multiple attempts were made to resolve it through the Minsk Agreements, but the implementation of these accords was continually hampered by ceasefire violations and the lack of a lasting compromise between the parties.\n\nDuring this period, Russia faced increasing economic sanctions, while Ukraine moved closer to Western countries, strengthening its cooperation with the EU and the United States and receiving military and economic support from them.\n\n2022: A World on the Brink of War\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the situation reached a peak of tension: the Russian side demanded guarantees for its own security and the protection of the Donbas population from perceived threats. It pointed to the potential further expansion of NATO eastward and the possible deployment of offensive weapons near its borders as major concerns for the Russian leadership.\n\nIn January and February 2022, negotiations were held between Russia and NATO, during which Russia demanded legally binding security guarantees — including a refusal to admit Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries into the North Atlantic Alliance, as well as a ban on the deployment of offensive missile systems and foreign troops near Russian borders.\n\nThe negotiations failed to produce a mutually acceptable outcome: NATO leaders emphasized every nation’s right to choose its own allies and security arrangements, while the Russian side interpreted the lack of compromise as a disregard for its core concerns and a signal for further escalation."
UKR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the Soviet Union’s dissolution in December 1991, Ukraine declared independence and gained international recognition. Inheriting a developed industrial base, skilled workforce, and formidable military—including nuclear weapons, which they relinquished in 1994 under the Budapest Memorandum in exchange for security assurances—Ukraine entered a challenging early 1990s marked by economic crisis, hyperinflation, and post-Soviet institutional collapse.\n\nUkraine's political system evolved into a pluralist but unstable framework. Oligarchic clans, corruption, and weak institutions eroded public trust. President Leonid Kuchma (1994–2005) pursued a multi-vectored approach between Russia and the West, reinforcing an oligarchic system. The pivotal Orange Revolution in 2004, sparked by election fraud, brought pro-West candidate Viktor Yushchenko to power but strained ties with Russia. Disillusionment with reforms later enabled a resurgence of pro-Russian forces.\n\nIn 2010, Viktor Yanukovych, representing eastern and southern Ukraine, became president and moved closer to Moscow. However, protests triggered by his veto of an EU association agreement in 2013 escalated into the Euromaidan (‘Revolution of Dignity’). In February 2014, Yanukovych fled, and a pro-European government took charge—transforming Ukraine’s path. Russia responded by annexing Crimea in March 2014, and the Donbas conflict erupted with Moscow’s backing. Ukraine was plunged into a prolonged war involving hybrid tactics: information warfare, economic pressure, and cyberattacks.\n\nSince 2014, Ukraine implemented extensive reforms in defense, governance, anti-corruption, and decentralization. Despite challenges, it achieved notable progress integrating with the EU and NATO. In 2019, comedian Vladimir Zelensky was elected on a platform promising anti-corruption, peace, and systemic reboot. By January 2022, Ukraine remained independent but geopolitically vulnerable—navigating reforms, rising national identity, Western alignment, persistent internal issues, and the looming threat of a large-scale Russian invasion."
NTO_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) was founded on April 4, 1949, as a military-political bloc of Western European and North American countries. Its primary objective was collective defense against potential aggression from the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. The key principle of the Alliance—Article 5 of the Washington Treaty—states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.\n\nAfter the collapse of the USSR and the end of the bipolar world, NATO not only survived but expanded to include Central and Eastern European countries formerly under Soviet influence. The first waves of expansion (1999, 2004) included Poland, the Czech Republic, the Baltic states, and the Balkans, provoking a negative reaction from Moscow, which saw this as a violation of informal agreements from the time of German reunification.\n\nAfter 2014, against the backdrop of Crimea's annexation and the conflict in Donbas, NATO-Ukraine cooperation deepened significantly. Although Ukraine did not receive membership status, it was recognized as an important partner. NATO provided Kyiv with comprehensive political, advisory, and technical support. Joint exercises were intensified, non-lethal aid was supplied, and cooperation in command, communications, cyber defense, and security sector reform was strengthened.\n\nIn 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, a Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine was adopted, encompassing dozens of projects for army modernization, crisis management, logistics, and countering hybrid threats. NATO actively supported reforms in Ukraine's defense sector, insisting on the adoption of NATO standards.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency (2016–2020), Ukraine remained a priority despite his general skepticism toward international alliances. The U.S., as NATO's largest member, continued military aid to Ukraine, including lethal weapons like Javelin anti-tank systems, drones, and communications equipment. The presence of U.S. and other NATO troops also increased in neighboring countries—Poland, Romania, and the Baltics—as a deterrent against Russia.\n\nIn December 2021, amid rising tensions and Russian troop buildup near Ukraine's borders, a round of talks was held between Russia, the U.S., and NATO. Moscow demanded legally binding guarantees against NATO expansion to the east, including a refusal to admit Ukraine. NATO reaffirmed its open-door policy and rejected the ultimatum, stating that Russia could not dictate security terms to other countries. The talks ended inconclusively, and the diplomatic pause became a prelude to further military conflict."
DPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "In the spring of 2014, amid Ukraine's political crisis following the Revolution of Dignity and Viktor Yanukovych's flight, pro-Russian protests intensified in the Donetsk region. On April 7, 2014, armed activists seized the Donetsk Regional Administration building and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Ukrainian authorities labeled these actions as separatism, launching an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), which escalated into armed conflict.\n\nFrom the outset, the DPR enjoyed Russian support—political, economic, personnel, and military—though Moscow officially denied direct involvement. By spring and summer 2014, clashes between Ukrainian forces and DPR militias turned into a positional war. The fiercest battles occurred near Sloviansk, Donetsk, and Ilovaisk. After the Ilovaisk tragedy in August and the intervention of Russian-backed forces, the conflict was frozen under the Minsk Agreements.\n\nBy 2015, the frontlines stabilized, but peace remained elusive. The DPR maintained de facto control over parts of Donetsk Oblast, including Donetsk, Makiivka, Horlivka, and other towns. The DPR's power structure was shaped by military commanders, pro-Russian politicians, and Russian administrators. Internal conflicts among factions, including the elimination of key warlords (such as Mozgovoy, Batman, Givi, and Motorola), led to tighter centralized control.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, the DPR gradually transformed into a quasi-state entity dependent on Russia. Its economy stagnated: much of its industry was destroyed or integrated into Russia's economic system. The population relied on pensions, social payments, and Russian humanitarian aid.\n\nBy January 2022, the DPR was a partially recognized, de facto Russian-controlled entity with a rigid power structure, limited civil freedoms, a militarized society, and complete dependence on external support. The entrenched conflict with Kyiv and gradual absorption by Russian structures made the DPR an inseparable element of the broader geopolitical confrontation between Russia and the West."
BLR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the USSR's collapse in December 1991, the Republic of Belarus declared independence and pursued stability and economic continuity. Its first president, Alexander Lukashenko, elected in 1994, quickly consolidated power, relying on Soviet-era bureaucracy and security forces. The country maintained a centralized economy with a significant state sector, ensuring relative social stability amid crises in other post-Soviet states.\n\nIn the 1990s, Belarus avoided major regional conflicts and political upheavals, but limited political competition and strict media control created an authoritarian model. Lukashenko used Soviet-era symbolism and stability slogans, securing support among much of the population.\n\nIn the 2000s, Belarus strengthened economic and political ties with Russia, particularly through the Union State and Customs Union, while balancing between Moscow and the West. Its foreign policy was pragmatic but prioritized regime preservation and sovereignty.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis and mass protests against the 2020 presidential election results heightened Minsk's fear of color revolutions and foreign interference. This led to a crackdown on opposition and tighter control. Belarus maintained close ties with Russia while avoiding direct involvement in Ukraine's conflict.\n\nBy January 2022, Belarus was an authoritarian state with power concentrated around Lukashenko, limited political freedoms, and a dominant role for security services. It remained a key Russian ally, especially in military and economic spheres, amid rising regional tensions."
RUS_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the USSR's collapse in December 1991, the Russian Federation inherited international recognition, a nuclear arsenal, and a UN Security Council seat but faced political and economic instability. The 1990s were marked by crisis: plummeting living standards, mass privatization, weak central authority, and regional separatism, including in Chechnya.\n\nVladimir Putin's rise to power in 2000 centralized authority. Federal institutions were strengthened, media and opposition parties were controlled. High oil prices stabilized the economy, boosting incomes and reducing poverty—creating the image of the \"stable 2000s.\" This bolstered Putin's popularity and solidified his power vertical. Foreign policy shifted toward restoring influence in the post-Soviet space through integration projects like the Eurasian Economic Union and CSTO.\n\nThe turning point came in 2004 with Ukraine's Orange Revolution—the first major blow to the \"Russian world\" project. In 2008, Russia intervened in Georgia, demonstrating its willingness to use force abroad. After Ukraine's 2014 Revolution of Dignity and Yanukovych's ouster, Russia annexed Crimea and backed armed groups in eastern Ukraine, sparking open conflict.\n\nSince 2014, Russia has faced sanctions, militarization, and tighter societal control. Ukraine, meanwhile, accelerated its NATO and EU integration with Western support. The Kremlin viewed this as a direct security threat and the loss of a strategic neighbor.\n\nBy January 2022, Russia was at a peak of tension: with a rigid power vertical, no political competition, a dominant role for security forces, and growing foreign confrontation. Massive troop deployments near Ukraine's borders and ultimatums to the West foreshadowed further escalation."
WGN_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The private military company 'Wagner' (PMC Wagner) is an unofficial structure linked to Russian mercenary activities abroad. Despite lacking official recognition in Russia, PMC Wagner became a tool of Kremlin foreign policy in conflict zones where direct military intervention was undesirable or politically sensitive.\n\nIts precursor was the 'Slavonic Corps,' a group of mercenaries sent to Syria in 2013 to guard energy facilities. The operation failed, with some fighters detained upon return. However, this laid the groundwork for a more controlled and secretive structure.\n\nPMC Wagner actively formed in 2014 amid the Donbas conflict. A unit under former GRU officer Dmitry Utkin (call sign 'Wagner') participated in battles for Debaltseve, Luhansk Airport, and Ilovaisk. Its ranks reportedly included veterans of Russian security forces operating as 'volunteers.'\n\nKey to its rise was informal patronage by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin—a St. Petersburg restaurateur, oligarch, and Putin ally. From 2014, Prigozhin-affiliated entities funded, supplied, and politically shielded Wagner. Contracts for recruitment and security services abroad were managed through his business empire (e.g., 'Concord').\n\nFrom 2015, Wagner became a key instrument of Russian intervention in Syria's civil war. Its units guarded strategic sites, supported Syrian army offensives, and secured oil infrastructure. A notorious incident occurred on February 7, 2018, near Deir ez-Zor, where Wagner fighters attacked U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, resulting in up to 100 mercenary deaths from U.S. airstrikes. Wagner also expanded into Africa, notably Libya and the Central African Republic."
LPR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "The Luhansk People's Republic was proclaimed on April 27, 2014, amid pro-Russian protests in Luhansk Oblast following Kyiv's post-Revolution of Dignity power shift. Like in Donetsk, protesters seized administrative buildings, held a 'referendum' on independence on May 11, 2014, and declared the LPR. Ukraine deemed these actions separatist and launched a military operation to restore control.\n\nThroughout spring and summer 2014, Luhansk Oblast saw intense fighting near Luhansk, Schastia, Lysychansk, and Debaltseve. After Ukrainian advances, a Russian-backed counteroffensive in August stabilized the frontlines, leading to the Minsk Agreements.\n\nIn subsequent years, the LPR, like the DPR, became an unrecognized quasi-state dependent on Russian support. Its power structure initially revolved around warlords, leading to internal purges, coups, and the elimination of key figures (e.g., former 'premier' Gennady Tsypkalov). Power gradually shifted to Moscow-loyal administrators.\n\nMilitary tensions persisted, with regular ceasefire violations along the contact line. Both sides accused each other of undermining peace. Meanwhile, the LPR formed armed forces modeled on Russia's, with instructors and supplies from Russia.\n\nBy January 2022, the LPR was a fully Moscow-dependent territory with high militarization, authoritarian rule, and a ruined economy. Escalating Russia-West tensions and border buildup made it a potential flashpoint."
POL_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the USSR's collapse and leaving the Warsaw Pact, Poland pursued integration into Western structures. In 1991, it co-founded the Visegrád Group and rapidly reformed its economy and political system. Poland became one of the first Eastern European countries to successfully transition to a market economy and parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn 1999, Poland joined NATO; in 2004, the EU. These steps cemented its strategic alignment, making it a key Western outpost on the eastern flank. Polish foreign policy since has been Atlanticist, emphasizing close ties with the U.S. and support for its eastern neighbors' Euro-integration, especially Ukraine's.\n\nFrom the 2000s, Poland actively backed Ukrainian independence and European aspirations. Warsaw supported the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. After Crimea's annexation and the Donbas war, Poland took a hardline anti-Russian stance, advocating for tougher EU sanctions and providing Ukraine political, humanitarian, and military aid.\n\nPolish-Ukrainian relations were strategic but complex. Historical issues—like WWII-era Volhynia massacres—periodically resurfaced in debates. However, since 2014, pragmatism prevailed amid shared threats.\n\nPoland became a transit hub for Western aid to Ukraine, a training ground for Ukrainian troops, and a platform for intelligence sharing. Polish politicians—both conservative (e.g., Law and Justice Party) and liberal—consistently championed Ukraine in Europe and internationally.\n\nBy January 2022, Poland was pivotal in EU and NATO eastern policy. It pushed for stronger Alliance presence in the region, developed its own defense capabilities, and prepared for potential destabilization. Relations with Ukraine reached strategic partnership levels, united by shared Russian threats, economic ties, and Europe's largest Ukrainian diaspora."
PMR_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "After the USSR's 1991 collapse, the predominantly Russian-speaking, pro-Russian eastern Moldovan region proclaimed the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR). Fears of Romanianization and unification with Romania drove its secession from Chișinău, sparking armed conflict.\n\nIn 1992, clashes between Moldovan forces and pro-Russian PMR militias escalated into a brief but bloody war. Russia's 14th Army, stationed in the region since Soviet times, intervened, freezing the conflict. The PMR became de facto independent but legally part of Moldova.\n\nThroughout the 1990s–2000s, the PMR developed as an unrecognized quasi-state with its own constitution, flag, currency, and education system. Russian support—military and economic—was its lifeline. Russia provided free gas and maintained troops under a 'peacekeeping' pretext.\n\nThe PMR's political system was authoritarian with token multipartyism. Its first and longest-serving leader, Igor Smirnov (1991–2011), was succeeded by Yevgeny Shevchuk and Vadim Krasnoselsky, who preserved pro-Russian policies while implementing minor reforms.\n\nThe economy relied on Russian aid, shadow trade, and the 'Sheriff' conglomerate, which dominated local markets and politics. Despite international mediation attempts (e.g., the '5+2' format), no settlement was reached.\n\nBy January 2022, the PMR remained an unrecognized, Russian-dependent entity with anti-Moldovan, anti-Western rhetoric, militarization, and Russian troops. It served as a Kremlin tool to counter Moldova's Euro-integration."
CHE_EAST_SHOWDOWN_DESC: "Legally, Chechnya remains a subject of the Russian Federation, but de facto it conducts independent domestic policy. Its special status began to form in the 1990s, when after the collapse of the USSR, the republic declared independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The First Chechen War (1994–1996) ended in a de facto victory for the militants and a temporary withdrawal of federal troops.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, Chechnya came under the control of field commanders and Sharia courts. With the start of the Second Chechen War in 1999, the federal center reestablished control. The Kremlin installed Akhmad Kadyrov, former mufti of the CRI who had sided with the federal forces, as the head of the newly formed entity. After his assassination, his son Ramzan took power. The remaining militants, driven out of Chechnya, proclaimed the Caucasus Emirate by 2007 — a radical underground that rejected the idea of Ichkeria and adopted the path of jihad across the entire North Caucasus.\n\nThe late 2000s and 2010s became a period of strengthening Ramzan Kadyrov’s personal power. With strong financial support from the federal budget, the republic was almost completely rebuilt: Grozny was transformed into a modern city with elements of Eastern monarchical architecture and a personality cult around Kadyrov Sr. Large-scale projects such as the ‘Heart of Chechnya‘ mosque became symbols of the new order, in which Islam, loyalty to the Kremlin, and a cult of strength merged into a single ideology.\n\nOutside the region, Kadyrov gained a reputation as a ‘regional satrap‘ with informal influence extending to the federal level, especially in matters related to the security apparatus. Chechen security forces were accused of systematic abductions both in Chechnya and beyond. Victims included local regime critics, federal human rights defenders, journalists, and Chechen expatriates living in other parts of Russia or even abroad. In addition, ‘Kadyrovtsy‘ were suspected of involvement in several high-profile political assassinations, including the 2015 murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov — right outside the Kremlin walls.\n\nBy early 2022, Chechnya was functioning de facto as a quasi-state entity within the Russian Federation: with its own foreign policy rhetoric, military formations, unique political culture, and a complete absence of federalism in the classical sense. Nevertheless, the republic formally remained part of the Russian legal framework, maintaining absolute loyalty to the Kremlin."
