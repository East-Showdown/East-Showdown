UNIT1:0 "§YThe mod§! adds a large amount of new equipment, expanded vehicle types and §Gslightly reworked supply systems§!. Combat units require more specialized equipment.\n\nIn addition to vehicles, the mod introduces §Ynew terrain types§!, affecting movement speed, casualties, reconnaissance effectiveness and defensive stability. Urban battles, forests, mountains and industrial zones become deadly battlefields. Constant meat-grinder assaults can lead to §Rheavy losses§!.\n\nThe player must carefully monitor §Ysupply§! and §Gproduction§!. Ignoring the needs of your army will quickly cause units to lose efficiency, and the frontline will begin to §Rcollapse and fall apart§!.§!"
 
 UNIT2:0 "§YIn East Showdown§!, a new §Gexperimental project system§! has been introduced — unique military and scientific developments available to each nation. These projects unlock advanced equipment, weapons and special improvements.\n\nThey become especially important in the §Ymid§! and §Ylate game§!. §GProperly chosen projects§! can radically strengthen your army and compensate for weaknesses."

 ESD_trucks_info:0 "§RThere is no separate 'trucks' equipment§! — their role is fulfilled by §Ylight armored vehicles§!."
 
 ESD_heavy_APC_info:0 "§YHeavy armored vehicles§! serve as a universal platform for support equipment. They can be converted into §Gmobile SAM launchers§!, §Gself-propelled artillery§! and §Gengineering vehicles§!.

 ENERGO:0 "§YThe national energy system§!\n—is the foundation of economic stability and industrial development. It shows whether the state produces enough electricity for the population, infrastructure and all sectors of production. The main goal is to maintain a §Gpositive energy balance§!: the more the country produces relative to consumption, the more stable industry becomes.\n\n§YElectricity production§!\nConsists of all power plants: thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric and alternative energy sources.\n\n§YEnergy consumption§!\nIncludes civilian needs, military and civilian factories, ports, research institutes and other infrastructure. If consumption exceeds generation, the country enters an energy deficit, weakening industrial performance.\n\n§YEnergy imports and exports§!\nHelp stabilize the system: shortages can be covered by importing electricity, while surplus can be exported for additional income. However, excessive reliance on imports makes production vulnerable to external threats, wars and sanctions.\n\n§YPower grid and substations§!\nDistribute electricity across the country.\n\nIf substations are insufficient or damaged, regions may become isolated and suffer blackouts. The indicator “regions with local blackout” shows how many territories are effectively without power.\n\n§OConsequences of energy deficit§!\nAre felt immediately:\n• stability decreases,\n• factory output drops,\n• repair speed slows,\n• logistics and military supply chains are disrupted.\nThe deeper the deficit, the harsher the penalties.\n\n§YEnergy system strategy§!\nInvolves expanding power generation, strengthening substations, protecting infrastructure from missile and drone attacks, and preventing dependency on imports. A well-managed energy system becomes the foundation of industrial growth and wartime resilience."

 AMMO_ECONOMY:0 "§YAmmunition§! is a strategic resource defining the effectiveness of the army. To maintain battlefield stability, you must keep a positive production balance and sufficient storage capacity.\n\n§YProduction§!\nOccurs at ammunition factories. The number of factories, their efficiency and allocated output determine final production levels. If factories are too few or inefficient, ammunition will be produced slowly.\n\n§YAmmunition storage§!\nDetermines how much ammo the country can store. The more storage you have, the larger your strategic reserve. If storage is full, excess production is lost; if storage is insufficient, the army will quickly drain its reserves.\n\n§YArmy consumption§!\nDepends on the number of divisions and battle intensity. Defensive operations consume less, while offensives consume significantly more. In severe shortages, firepower, defense, entrenchment and unit readiness all decrease — divisions may even become combat-ineffective.\n\n§OImportant:§!\nIf production and delivery do not cover consumption, stockpiles will decline. Prolonged shortage leads to failed operations and loss of combat capability.\n\n§YRecommendations§!: build more factories, increase storage capacity, monitor daily balance and avoid excessive offensives. A reliable ammunition supply system is the key to successful warfare."

 UKR_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Ukraine"

 UKR_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, §YUkraine§! enters the new year as an independent European state, having defended itself against Russian aggression for eight years while simultaneously carrying out internal modernization. The country remains at the center of a geopolitical struggle between the free world and Russia’s authoritarian model, preserving stability, democracy, and its aspiration for a European future.\n\n§YStatehood and Political Course§!\nAfter the Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine firmly defined its path: integration with the European Union, cooperation with NATO, strengthening democracy, fighting corruption, digitalization of public services, and reforming the army, judiciary and economy. Despite gas pressure, cyberattacks and attempts at destabilization from Russia, Ukraine maintains its political course and keeps state institutions resilient.\n\n§YRussian Aggression§!\nSince 2014, Ukraine has lived under conditions of the Russian–Ukrainian war. Russia occupied Crimea, created and armed puppet entities in Donbas, and deployed regular troops into Ukraine, violating international law. The Kremlin conducts hybrid warfare — cyberattacks, disinformation, economic pressure, political provocations — and concentrates forces near Ukrainian borders, creating the threat of a full-scale invasion. The Minsk agreements remain blocked, as Russia uses them as leverage rather than a pathway to peace.\n\n§YArmed Forces of Ukraine§!\nBy early 2022, the AFU became one of the most capable militaries in Eastern Europe. Based on eight years of combat experience, Ukraine strengthened its Special Operations Forces, Air Assault Forces, Marines, and Territorial Defense. NATO standards are being implemented in logistics, communications and command. Ukraine receives support from the U.S., U.K., Turkey, Poland and other allies. The army fields Neptune anti-ship missiles, Bayraktar TB2 strike drones, and modern artillery and reconnaissance systems. The military has become the key shield holding back Russian aggression.\n\n§YEconomy Under Pressure§!\nDespite war and Russian economic pressure, Ukraine has maintained macroeconomic stability. Key sectors include agriculture (one of the world’s largest grain exporters), metallurgy, chemical industry, engineering, energy and a rapidly growing IT sector. Trade with the EU far exceeds trade with Russia. Ukraine is gradually reducing its energy dependence on the Russian Federation, developing alternative routes and cooperating with Europe, the U.S. and Asian markets.\n\n§YUkrainian Society§!\nBy 2022, Ukrainians have formed a strong national identity. Volunteer movements flourish, the role of the Ukrainian language and culture strengthens, patriotism grows, and civil society is highly active. A new generation no longer sees Russia as a “brother nation”—for Ukrainians, the Russian Federation has become an aggressor trying to destroy their freedom and independence. Ukrainian society has become mature, united and ready to defend its values.\n\n§YInternational Position§!\nUkraine is a key element of European security. The country strengthens its strategic partnership with the United States, expands cooperation with NATO, and deepens ties with Poland, Lithuania, the United Kingdom and Turkey. It receives political, financial and military support from the EU. Through the “Crimean Platform”, Ukraine promotes international pressure on Russia."

 RUS_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Russia"
 RUS_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, the §YRussian Federation§! enters the new year as the largest power in Eurasia, possessing powerful armed forces, a stable political system, and an independent foreign policy. Under growing Western pressure, Russia seeks to protect its national interests, sovereignty, and the right to follow its own path.\n\n§YPolitical System and Domestic Course§!\nBy early 2022, Russia has formed a centralized governance model with strong presidential authority, a stable parliament, and a resilient government. Moscow believes that the United States and its allies are attempting to create a belt of instability around Russia, using Ukraine and Eastern European states as tools of political pressure.\n\n§YRelations with Ukraine§!\nFrom Russia’s perspective, Ukraine has been under Western influence since the events of 2014 and pursues an anti-Russian policy. Moscow is convinced that Kyiv is pushing out the Russian language and culture, while the conflict in Donbas is seen as a reaction of the local population against imposed ideology. Russia considers itself a defender of Russian-speaking citizens and views Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO with deep concern.\n\n§YArmed Forces and Defense§!\nBy 2022, the Russian Armed Forces are among the largest and most technologically advanced in the world. The country has modernized its ground forces, Aerospace Forces, and Navy, developing missile systems such as Iskander, Kalibr, and air defense systems S-400 and S-500. Russia sees NATO as the main source of threat, especially due to the alliance’s military infrastructure in Eastern Europe and its support for Ukraine.\n\n§YEconomy Under Sanctions§!\nDespite sanctions imposed since 2014, Russia maintains macroeconomic stability. It remains one of the world’s largest exporters of gas and oil, develops agriculture, import substitution, and the defense industry. Economic ties with China, India and the Middle East are strengthening. Moscow sees sanctions as a political tool aimed at restricting the country’s development.\n\n§YInternational Policy§!\nRussia promotes a multipolar world and opposes American dominance. Moscow deepens partnerships with China and India, and actively participates in the UN, EAEU and CSTO. NATO expansion, in Russia’s view, undermines the security balance and poses a direct threat to its interests.\n\n§YSociety and Identity§!\nRussian society is marked by rising patriotism, support for independence from the West, and the strengthening of traditional values. Many citizens perceive NATO policy and Ukrainian nationalism as threats to national stability. The army and the state play a major role in shaping national identity.\n\nAs of January 1, 2022, Russia views itself as a sovereign power surrounded by an unfriendly Western bloc and a hostile Ukraine, yet ready to defend its interests with its military strength, diplomatic resources, and patriotic society."

 NTO_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "NATO"
 NTO_country_paths:0 "§YNATO§! — the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, founded in 1949 to provide collective defense for the states of Western Europe and North America. Its foundation is the principle of §G“one for all and all for one”§!: an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. The military machine of the democratic world has spent decades confronting communist regimes, terrorist organizations, and any threat capable of undermining Western security.\n\nDuring the Cold War, NATO developed strategies based on air superiority and precision strikes, ensuring global military dominance. The §Y1990s§! became a turning point: the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the dissolution of the USSR, and the fall of the Berlin Wall changed the world. To prevent nuclear proliferation, all former Soviet republics surrendered their nuclear arsenals—except Russia. NATO increasingly participated in international operations: the Balkans, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean. Europe entered an era of perceived safety: armies downsized, factories closed, equipment was scrapped, and defense industries weakened.\n\n§OPost-Soviet conflicts drew little NATO attention§!: they were viewed as “regional Russian problems.” In the Middle East, the alliance proved its effectiveness—Operation Desert Storm demonstrated NATO’s ability to strike fast and decisively.\n\nThe §Y2000s§! were marked by NATO expansion into former socialist countries. Russia was even considered a potential partner. However, many European allies failed to meet the 2% GDP defense spending standard—Europe effectively disarmed. Meanwhile, the United States entered the global War on Terror after 9/11. Simultaneously, Russia increased its influence through energy: cheap gas strengthened European economies, while Moscow gained new tools of leverage and loyal politicians.\n\n§RThe 2008 war in Georgia was ignored by NATO§!. The attempted “reset” between the U.S. and Russia benefited only Moscow. In 2014, NATO’s response to the annexation of Crimea was weak: sanctions and statements did little to restrain Russia. Europe did not perceive the Kremlin as a threat, preferring dialogue. Only near the end of the Trump administration did meaningful support for Ukraine begin.\n\nSince 2021, intelligence agencies of various countries have reported Russia preparing for a full-scale invasion. Experts confidently predicted: Ukraine would last no more than a week.\n\n§RWhat could go wrong?§! Russia demonstrated an ability to shift regional balances, as seen in Syria.\n\n§Y2022 became a test for the alliance§! — a test of political will, solidarity, and the ability to carry out collective defense. But its primary task at the time was clear: to provide Ukraine with weapons and prepare it for potential partisan warfare."

POL_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Poland"
 POL_country_paths:0 "§YPoland§! is a state with a complex and turbulent history — a nation that at times dominated Eastern Europe and at other times fell under the rule of foreign powers. After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR, the country entered a new era of rapid change. The economic reforms of the 1990s, accession to §YNATO§! in 1999 and §Ythe EU§! in 2004 brought Poland stability and accelerated its development, gradually closing the gap with Western Europe.\n\nPoland faced several major challenges: the 2008 financial crisis, the Smolensk catastrophe of 2010 that took the lives of much of its political elite, and the events of 2014 — Euromaidan, Russia’s occupation of Crimea and the war in Donbas. Poland drew conclusions and embarked on distancing itself from Russia and massively modernizing its armed forces.\n\nIt is January 1, 2022 — and this year may become another turning point. Intelligence reports warn of Russia preparing for a full-scale war. Allies predict that Ukraine will resist no more than a week, and Poland — like the rest of Europe — enters a new era of uncertainty.\n\n§YPolish–Ukrainian and Polish–Russian relations§! have always been complex. History left painful issues: the Volyn tragedy for Poles, and the pacification of Western Ukraine for Ukrainians. After World War II, the two nations found themselves separated by political systems: Poland in the socialist bloc, Ukraine in the USSR. After the collapse of the USSR, Poland was among the first to recognize Ukrainian independence. Relations improved, though historical grievances remained.\n\nThe events of 2014 changed everything: the threat from Russia became obvious, and Poland intensified militarization, conducted large exercises, and strengthened cooperation with Kyiv. The result was the creation of the Lublin Triangle — a cooperation format between Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania.\n\nRelations with Russia developed differently. For Poles, Russia is historically an empire that twice erased Polish statehood: the partitions of the 18th century, the 1920 war, the joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the USSR in 1939, and later the creation of a Soviet-controlled communist regime. Attempts to improve relations in the 2000s failed: the Smolensk crash and Russian aggression against Ukraine ended the illusion of peaceful coexistence. For many Poles, Russia again became a traditional adversary.\n\n§YModern era§!: Poland deliberately invests in massive militarization — sharply increasing defense spending, purchasing modern equipment, developing territorial defense and strengthening NATO troop presence. The country is turning into the eastern shield of the Alliance.\n\nEntering 2022, Poland feels prepared, relying on years of reforms and military modernization. Polish society supports a strong defensive course, and official doctrines directly name Russia as a potential adversary. Poland enters the new year wary, but confident — aware of the threats and ready to confront them."

 WGN_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Wagner PMC"
 WGN_country_paths:0 "§YBy early 2022, the Wagner Private Military Company§! had transformed from a small, almost unknown formation into one of the most influential non-state armed organizations in the world. Emerging in the shadows of conflicts in Donbas and Syria, the group quickly adapted to its role as a flexible instrument of Russian foreign policy, operating where traditional military presence was too risky or undesirable.\n\nThe company’s early core formed around veterans of Russian special operations forces, some connected to earlier private military structures. Its backbone consisted of professional fighters with extensive experience — from GRU Spetsnaz to Airborne Forces — allowing the creation of an elite core capable of operating in the most difficult theaters of war.\n\n§YStructure and Training§!\nBy 2022, Wagner had its own command system, multi-level training programs and unique recruitment methods. Training grounds — including the well-known Molkino base — provided instruction for riflemen, artillery crews, scouts, assault troops, and security units. Independent logistics, equipment, information units and limited air support enabled Wagner to conduct operations simultaneously in several regions of the world.\n\n§YGeography of Operations§!\nInternationally, Wagner became a symbol of “shadow power.” As of 2022, its fighters operated in:\n • Syria — supporting government forces, clearing operations, guarding oil facilities;\n • Ukraine — participating in early stages of the Donbas conflict;\n • Libya — assisting the LNA and Haftar’s forces;\n • Central African Republic — protecting authorities, training the army, working in extraction projects;\n • Mali — first contingents arrived in late 2021.\nWagner also performed escort missions, facility protection, military consulting and localized operations across Africa and the Middle East.\n\nEach new mission expanded the company’s influence, providing access to resources, contracts and political patronage.\n\n§YEconomic Base and Interests§!\nDespite its “private company” status, Wagner’s funding structure remained opaque. Contracts with African governments, participation in gold and diamond extraction, and covert support from Russia created a stable revenue network. By 2022, Wagner managed a group of affiliated entities — from security firms to geological exploration companies — forming its own military–economic ecosystem.\n\n§YReputation and Perception§!\nWagner became a symbol of strength, secrecy and readiness to operate where others fail. For some, it is a professional private army. For others, an instrument of Russian strategy. For many more, an organization with unclear legal status and a high degree of secrecy.\n\nInternational media regularly linked Wagner to operations that states preferred to keep hidden. Yet it was precisely this ability to operate outside official structures that turned the group into one of the key actors in global non-state conflicts."

 CHE_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Chechen Republic"
 CHE_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, the §YChechen Republic§! remains one of the most unique and controversial regions of the Russian Federation — a territory that has passed through wars, massive reconstruction, political centralization, and the formation of its own governance model. After the destructive conflicts of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the republic entered a period of “peaceful development” — a time authorities call stability, while critics describe it as an era of strict control.\n\nUnder the leadership of Ramzan Kadyrov, the region has effectively become an autonomous political center, closely tied to the federal government yet possessing significant internal independence. Grozny, rebuilt almost from scratch, became the showcase of the new Caucasus: grand mosques, modern complexes, a wide network of security forces, and an emphasis on order and safety.\n\n§YSecurity Forces and Influence§!\nSpecial units loyal to the regional leadership play a decisive role. These forces have actively participated in counterterrorism operations, internal security enforcement, and demonstrations of power. Their reputation combines effectiveness with harsh methods, while the region presents itself as a stronghold of stability in the North Caucasus.\n\n§YInternal Politics§!\nAs of early 2022, Chechnya’s political system is characterized by an extremely high level of centralization. The head of the republic holds strong influence over the parliament, security structures, and religious institutions. Power rests on personal loyalty, traditional Caucasian norms, religious authority, and close ties with the Kremlin. A unique ideological model has formed — a mix of Chechen identity, Islamic traditions, and demonstrative loyalty to the federal center.\n\n§YEconomy and Development§!\nThe region’s economy relies heavily on federal subsidies, yet construction, infrastructure, agriculture, and tourism-related areas are developing. Grozny projects the image of a modern and secure city capable of hosting business events and attracting investment. However, high dependence on budget funding and limited economic diversification keep the region vulnerable.\n\n§YSociety and Identity§!\nBy 2022, Chechen society is in a stage of consolidation and recovery. Traditional norms grow stronger, and Islam — especially Sufi traditions — plays a more pronounced role. Spiritual leaders maintain close ties with authorities, and religious infrastructure expands at a rapid pace. Strong leadership, security, the rebirth of Grozny, and national unity have become central elements of the modern Chechen identity.\n\n§YPosition in Russia and the Caucasus§!\nChechnya remains a strategically crucial region for Moscow: stability in the North Caucasus is directly tied to the governability and loyalty of the republic. In exchange for support and resources, the federal center receives a reliable ally, while Grozny maintains its own governance model with a high degree of personalized power.\n\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Chechen Republic stands at the crossroads of tradition, modernization and political specificity. Having transformed from the epicenter of war into a symbol of a rebuilt Caucasus, the region strives to maintain its stability and strengthen its influence within Russia and its own cultural sphere."

 DPR_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Donetsk People's Republic"
 DPR_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, the §YDonetsk People's Republic (DPR)§! remains an unrecognized state formation in eastern Ukraine, controlling part of the Donetsk region and existing under conditions of prolonged conflict, diplomatic uncertainty, and constant military pressure. Eight years have passed since the confrontation began in spring 2014, and the region enters the new year without clear political prospects or a definitive settlement.\n\n§YOrigins and Political Structure§!\nAfter the events of spring 2014, the DPR was proclaimed in Donetsk, relying on local armed groups, administrative networks, and part of the population’s support. Over time, the republic created its own governance system: a parliament, government, judicial bodies, and administrative structures oriented toward centralization and closer ties with Russia. By early 2022, the political landscape had largely stabilized around leadership supporting integration into the Russian economic and humanitarian sphere, despite international isolation and the stalemate of the Minsk process.\n\n§YMilitary Situation§!\nThe military factor remains central to the DPR’s existence. The line of contact with Ukrainian forces remains tense despite periodic ceasefires. Along the front, shelling, sniper activity, reconnaissance actions, and localized clashes continue. DPR armed formations consist of regularized corps, volunteer units, and reserve forces relying on both internal resources and external support. Large areas along the front line remain destroyed, mined, or depopulated.\n\n§YEconomic and Humanitarian Conditions§!\nThe DPR economy faces severe difficulties: disrupted supply chains, damaged infrastructure, limited market access, and dependence on external assistance create a fragile survival model. Key sectors include coal mining, remnants of industrial production, small business, internal trade, humanitarian aid, and partial integration with nearby Russian regional economies. Donetsk, Makiivka and Horlivka are slowly rebuilding, though many areas remain in decline, suffering from lack of investment and logistics.\n\n§YSociety and Identity§!\nYears of conflict have formed a generation for whom war is the backdrop of daily life. The population adapted to blockades, movement restrictions and political uncertainty. The evolving identity of the DPR is shaped by ideas of resistance, memory of 2014 events, desire for stability, and cultural alignment with Russia. At the same time, many residents live under economic hardship and constant risk of escalation, though schools, hospitals, transport and civic infrastructure continue to function in major cities.\n\n§YInternational Position§!\nFrom the perspective of international law, the DPR remains an unrecognized entity viewed by most states as part of Ukraine. The Minsk negotiations are effectively frozen. Nevertheless, the republic continues developing internal institutions and strengthening humanitarian and economic ties with Russia."

 LPR_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Luhansk People's Republic"

 LPR_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, the §YLuhansk People's Republic (LPR)§! remains an unrecognized state formation in eastern Ukraine, controlling part of the former Luhansk region. The conflict that began in spring 2014 has shaped the region for eight years, turning the LPR into a territory of prolonged war, political uncertainty, and gradual formation of its own governmental structures.\n\n§YBirth of the Republic and Political Structure§!\nFollowing the events of spring 2014, the LPR was proclaimed in Luhansk. The early months were marked by chaos, rapid militia formation, street battles, and power shifts. Over time, the republic built a more centralized governance system: its own government, parliament, judiciary, security forces, and a vertical power structure oriented toward closer integration with Russia and stronger territorial control. International isolation remains nearly complete, and the Minsk agreements have not produced real political progress.\n\n§YMilitary Situation§!\nThe military situation in the LPR remains tense. The line of contact with Ukrainian forces stretches across several key settlements, and despite periodic ceasefires, shelling, sniper activity, and localized clashes continue. LPR military formations include corps, independent brigades, reconnaissance units, artillery, and armored divisions. Much of their equipment is repaired or upgraded under field conditions. Frontline areas remain partially mined, destroyed, and depopulated.\n\n§YEconomic and Humanitarian Situation§!\nThe economy of the LPR faces severe challenges: blockades, disrupted economic ties, damaged infrastructure, and a lack of investment create an unstable survival model. Key sectors include coal mining, limited metallurgy and industry, internal trade and small business, humanitarian aid and external support, and partial economic integration with neighboring Russian regions. Luhansk, Alchevsk, Krasnodon and other cities adapt to isolation: schools, hospitals, and transport continue operating, and some public infrastructure is being restored. Nevertheless, equipment shortages, lack of major investment, and high social tension persist.\n\n§YSociety and Identity§!\nYears of conflict have shaped a unique social identity based on memories of 2014, ideas of resistance, aspirations for stability, and cultural closeness to Russia. The population lives under economic pressure and constant risk of escalation but continues its daily life: markets operate, schools are open, and cities celebrate holidays.\n\n§YInternational Position§!\nFrom the standpoint of international law, the LPR remains an unrecognized entity viewed by most states as part of Ukraine. The Minsk negotiation process is stalled, and prospects of diplomatic settlement remain uncertain. Meanwhile, the republic deepens its humanitarian, social, and economic ties with Russia: the Russian ruble is used, educational programs expand, humanitarian routes operate, and procedures for obtaining Russian documents are simplified.\n."

 BLR_COUNTRY_NAME:0 "Republic of Belarus"

 BLR_country_paths:0 "As of January 1, 2022, the §YRepublic of Belarus§! remains a state with a unique political model embedded in the post-Soviet space, balancing internal stability, economic challenges, and its close alliance with the Russian Federation. Recent years have brought political tension, deteriorating relations with the West, and increasing sanctions pressure — forcing Minsk to search for new survival mechanisms and deepen integration with Moscow.\n\n§YPolitical System§!\nBelarus maintains a highly centralized political system built on a strong vertical of power and control over key institutions. President Alexander Lukashenko, in office since 1994, holds the main levers of governance, relying on security agencies, state structures, and large state enterprises. The growing role of security forces and the controlled information sphere allow authorities to preserve internal order, though they also deepen political polarization in society.\n\n§YInternal Situation§!\nAfter the unrest and protests of 2020–2021, the government restored control. The influence of security forces increases, legislation tightens, the state sector continues to dominate the economy, and the media environment remains mostly state-controlled. At the same time, infrastructure functions steadily: factories, institutions, transportation, and social programs continue working, while authorities emphasize stability and order.\n\n§YEconomic Situation§!\nThe Belarusian economy is under serious pressure from EU and U.S. sanctions, but remains intact. Core industries include large state-owned enterprises in machinery, oil refining, chemical production, and potash fertilizers. The country depends heavily on Russian loans, energy, and access to the Russian market. The economy is stable but highly dependent on external support, transit flows, and export channels.\n\n§YSecurity and Military§!\nSecurity forces play a key role in Belarusian politics. The army is considered one of the most organized in the region, regularly participating in joint exercises with Russia and safeguarding borders. Russian military facilities operate on Belarusian territory, and allied defense cooperation continues to expand. Belarus remains a crucial strategic corridor between Russia and Europe, increasing its regional significance.\n\n§YRelations With Russia and the Union State§!\nBy early 2022, cooperation with Moscow reached its deepest point in years. Belarus expands integration within the Union State, advancing roadmaps on economic policy alignment, energy markets, taxation, customs rules, and military cooperation. There is no formal loss of sovereignty, but political and economic dependence on Russia becomes the defining factor of Minsk’s domestic and foreign policy.\n\n§YSociety and Identity§!\nBelarusian society remains divided between supporters of strict stability and advocates of reform. The country maintains high educational standards, promotes traditional values, strengthens the role of Orthodoxy and secular statehood. National identity combines Soviet heritage, Russian-language culture, and Belarusian symbols. Major cities — Minsk, Gomel, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Brest — show external order and relative stability despite political and economic challenges.\n\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Republic of Belarus stands at a crossroads between East and West, between economic dependence and aspirations for autonomy, between internal stability and political divides. The country's future depends on relations with Russia, the scale of international pressure, economic resilience, and society’s ability to adapt to new realities."
