WGN.37.t: "Putin Comments on Prigozhin’s Statement"
WGN.37.desc: "Asked in St Petersburg about Yevgeny Prigozhin’s recent appeal, Vladimir Putin said:\n\n“Mr Prigozhin is an energetic patriot; I have known him for years. His contribution, including to the SMO, is significant, and we value it. I have read his letter carefully but find his accusations groundless. Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov are professionals working in extremely difficult conditions, and I trust their decisions.\n\nThe shell issue Prigozhin raises is complex and linked to objective constraints. We are addressing it; no one is deliberately weakening anyone. Our goal is shared. I am sure misunderstandings can be settled at working level without emotion. Yevgeny Viktorovich speaks bluntly out of love for the Motherland. The main thing is to keep working together for victory.”"
WGN.37.a: "The President is deeply mistaken…"

WGN.36.t: "Sergei Shoigu Resigns"
WGN.36.desc: "Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, responsible for thousands of Russian deaths and months of obstruction of Wagner, has resigned “for health reasons”. Public outrage and our relentless accusations did their job.\n\nShoigu’s ‘achievements’: corruption, cronyism, MO collapse, front-line sabotage, SVO failure, huge losses—the list is long. He is gone and will answer for his deeds; Valery Gerasimov’s competence is already under review.\n\nThese scum will face the court of history. Wagner fighters will keep fighting for Russia. Acting minister Col-Gen Yunus-Bek Yevkurov is already in contact to restore ammunition supply. Hard work ahead."

Now there is cause to reshuffle and remove those hindering the army—especially certain Tuvan figures.\n\nThis proves the President is not in an information vacuum.

I know the depots, the batch numbers, the crates. Yet I cannot fix the problem despite all my connections—everything bogs down. Some officers risk their careers to give us extra rounds.\n\nOfficials point upward and say: ‘You know, Yevgeny Viktorovich, your relations up there are difficult; go beg forgiveness and your men will get ammo.’ Before whom should I apologise so my lads die half as often? 140 million Russians, tell me!\n\nI don’t accuse anyone; I just say: drop your whims and give the ammunition.

WGN.42.desc: "Yevgeny Viktorovich has again spoken from the front. The ammo situation remains dire; here is the “First’s” comment:\n\n“Why are shells lying in depots? I’ll explain. There are people who fight, and there are people who once learned somewhere that ‘there must be a reserve’ and just hoard and hoard. The industry churns out shells, yet instead of sending them to the troops they pile them up on some warehouses—nobody knows why.\n\nInstead of spending a shell to kill the enemy and save a Russian soldier, they kill our soldiers, while a happy grandpa thinks things are fine. And what will the country do if, God forbid, it turns out that this grandpa is in fact a total moron? What then for our children, grandchildren, Russia’s future—how do we win the war?”"

WGN.46.desc: "Videos from the front show RF servicemen — draftees and contract troops — voicing anger at their commanders and begging to join Wagner units.\n\nMen of the 374th Separate Rifle Battalion report being sent forward without food, water or ammo; wounded are left behind. They refuse to keep fighting under such conditions and demand transfer to the “Orchestra”. Mobilised soldiers of the 1252nd Rifle Regiment speak of severe food shortages and an acute ammo deficit.\n\nWagner’s professionalism and brotherhood have become a beacon, pushing regulars to seek protection and fairness under our banner."

WGN.47.t: "Shells Donated by Natalia Khim"
WGN.47.desc: "Former *Dom-2* participant Natalia Khim has delivered a batch of shells bought with her own funds for Wagner. Since 2014 she has aided Donbas and, after the SMO began, ramped up her activism. She noted: “If I, a ‘reality-show girl’, could wring out shells, then the Defence Ministry surely can. Just work and share — otherwise we’ll blow it all. Power is in the truth.”"

WGN.48.desc: "A few days ago General Sergey Surovikin approached Wagner’s leadership, offering to settle the conflict with the Russian MoD. Given his authority and ties inside the ministry, it looked as though the issue had been resolved in our favor.\n\n“We received an operational order (…) which, without the classified details, boils down to this: they promise us as many shells and weapons as we need to keep fighting,” Yevgeny Viktorovich said.\n\nYet days passed and nothing changed: no shells, no direct answers to our requests. No-one intends to act."
WGN.48.a: "Bloody liars"

WGN.49.t: "Prigozhin on the Shell Crisis — Follow-up"
WGN.49.desc: "General Surovikin recently offered to mediate between Wagner and the MoD, and it seemed the matter was settled.\n\n“We got an order (…) promising exactly the ammunition we need to keep going. A few days later some rounds did start arriving through MTO, yet the figure still slides toward zero. If you think 25 % of the required amount will satisfy us, you’re badly mistaken. MoD officials give shells neither to me, nor to Mizintsev back when he ran MTO, nor to Surovikin. Why? My soldiers won’t fight condemned to senseless death without ammunition,” Prigozhin stated."

WGN.55.t: "Big Interview with Yevgeny Prigozhin — Part I"
WGN.55.desc: "In a frank, hard-hitting interview, Prigozhin offers a blunt assessment of the Special Military Operation. He lashes the top brass for lies and blunders. According to him, in February 2022 there was no real threat from Ukraine or NATO — the generals simply invented one so the freak Shoigu could grab a Marshal’s star. He insists Kyiv never planned to storm Donbas and the wider war was avoidable.\n\nThe operation, he says, was botched from day one. The MoD had no plan for genuine high-intensity combat. Chaos, lack of strategy and indifference to soldiers’ lives led to catastrophic losses. Prigozhin names the numbers and the truth — unlike those hiding behind polished reports. He praises the heroism of fighters, including ex-convicts he brought into the line, who earned redemption with blood.\n\nHe contrasts frontline sacrifice with the cynical apathy of Shoigu and Gerasimov, clinging to power at any cost. Prigozhin claims the President often receives sugar-coated briefings far from reality.\n\nHis words are not “whining” or “panic”, as Kremlin careerists claim, but a bitter truth the authorities find inconvenient."

Ice-covered sidewalks became lethal, roadside snowbanks blocked lanes for weeks, paid parking remained buried. The local band ‘Leningrad’, led by Sergey Shnurov, mocked the city hall’s failure in their trademark style, releasing two provocative clips: ‘Poka Tak’ and ‘Pokayannaya’. Packed with sarcasm and expletives, they target Governor Alexander Beglov’s inability to clear snow and garbage.\n\nBehind this media strike on the northern capital’s administration stands none other than Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin. His hostile relations with Beglov stem from a string of failed business ventures, such as the ‘Gorskaya’ tourist zone, and the blocking of his candidates during city-council elections.\n\nAs a thank-you for the generous donation to the band and fruitful cooperation, ‘Leningrad’ even wrote a private song for Prigozhin titled ‘Chef Prigozhin’, performed for a select audience."

My conscience and my duty to the fighters who sacrifice their lives for Russia every day do not allow me to remain silent while I witness flagrant injustice, betrayal and criminal negligence that undermine the success of the Special Military Operation and the future of our state.\n\nFor many months my men and I have faced systematic sabotage by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, namely by the Minister of Defence Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov.\n\nUnder their leadership the MoD has deliberately starved Wagner of ammunition, forcing assault groups to attack without proper artillery preparation while depots are bursting with shells; their incompetent conduct of the SMO not only slows our advance but has cost the lives of thousands of Russian soldiers and volunteers — a criminal negligence bordering on treason. Russian men, the best sons of the Fatherland, die not so much from enemy actions as from lack of resources, poor coordination and senseless orders — what can only be called genocide of the Russian people. On top of that, rampant corruption, indiscipline, cronyism and greed, all indulged by the above-mentioned figures, morally rot the army and drive it toward self-destruction.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, I implore you, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief and as the democratically elected President of Russia, to intervene.

Let us fight for Russia as we know how — with full commitment and without rear-area intrigue.\n\nI believe in your resolve and that you will not allow the personal interests of a few to endanger the interests of the state.

WGN.10.d: "The Private Military Company (PMC) “Wagner” is a Russian non-state armed formation founded on 1 May 2014 by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin and former GRU officer Dmitry Utkin. Utkin’s callsign “Wagner” gave the group its name. The PMC has no legal status in Russia; its activity technically falls under the Criminal Code article on mercenarism (Art. 359). Yet Prigozhin’s ties to President Putin allowed the group not only to operate outside Russian law but also to receive large state subsidies.\n\nSince 2014 Wagner has fought wherever Russian interests required. In 2014-2015 the group operated in eastern Ukraine, backing separatists in battles for Luhansk Airport and Debaltseve while giving the Kremlin plausible deniability. From 2015 Wagner deployed to Syria, supporting Bashar al-Assad against ISIS, guarding oil fields and helping retake Palmyra. From 2017 it expanded across Africa (CAR, Sudan, Libya, Mali, Mozambique), propping up regimes, training forces and securing Russia’s economic stakes in exchange for access to resources—gold, diamonds, uranium.\n\nBy January 2022 Wagner had earned a reputation for iron discipline, hard training and grim resilience—from the blazing steppe of Donbas to the deserts of Syria and the jungles of Central Africa. As tensions flare in Ukraine and Russian-speakers face renewed threats, the “Orchestra” stands ready—honed in battle, unbroken in resolve—to redeploy east at the call of the Motherland."

WGN.54.desc: "— You heard Adam Delimkhanov’s message to Prigozhin?\n— I’ve no time for TikToks, internets and the rest. We do combat work. Everyone should mind his own business and stop pontificating—especially on military matters."
WGN.54.a: "And where’s the lie?"

WGN.11.t: "‘The war was for the oligarchs…’"
WGN.11.d: "In a new long interview Yevgeny Prigozhin lays out who started the war and why. Most MoD briefings, he says, are mere window-dressing; everything unfolding in Ukraine benefits not the state but the oligarchs long embedded in government. For those scum a common soldier’s life is cheaper than a shell, while Shoigu lied to the president and launched the war just to snag a marshal’s star with extra braid. The conversation went viral, raising awkward questions for the MoD and the Kremlin."
WGN.11.a: "Donbas has been looted since 2014!"

WGN.12.t: "Russian Army laying mines in our rear"
WGN.12.d: "Our sappers have just found explosives on routes used by Wagner rear convoys. At first we blamed Ukrainian DRGs—but the trail leads to Russian regulars. Yesterday Lt-Col Vinyavitin of the RF Armed Forces fired on a Wagner vehicle, citing ‘personal antipathy’. Proof of these outrages has been published and is spreading fast. Such incidents multiply: the MoD grows ever more inventive in its efforts to hobble and destroy the Orchestra. Something must be done."
WGN.12.a: "They’ll answer for every deed!"
WGN.13.t: "\"Shoigu’s son-in-law wiggles his buns in Dubai while ordinary people get their kids back in zinc coffins…\""
WGN.13.d: "Yevgeny Prigozhin has again given an interview, this time to Konstantin Dolgov of the livestream show “Telega Online”. During the hour-long chat he laid into the training, equipment and organisation of Russia’s Armed Forces. He said that only now—thanks to the “lessons of war” in Ukraine—can Russia be called a combat-ready state, and even that is a stretch. Prigozhin also lambasted Shoigu and the minister’s son-in-law Stolyarov, who lives comfortably in Dubai. The sharp remarks have once more split patriotic opinion online, yet everyone understands one thing: while scum like Shoigu and Gerasimov run the army, victory is impossible."
WGN.13.a: "Melt Shoigu down for soap!"

WGN.14.t: "Wagner is orphaned"
WGN.14.d: "Shocking news from Tver Oblast: the private jet of our PMC’s chief has crashed near Kuzhenkino. Rosaviatsiya says Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin were on board. Their inner circle cannot reach them. Though bodies are not yet identified, it is virtually certain that Dima and Zhenya are dead. We know exactly who organised the murder of Russia’s greatest patriots. Trusting the Kremlin’s bald rats was a fatal error—and it has cost us our commanders. Without them Wagner is beheaded."
WGN.14.a: "Is this… the end?"

WGN.15.t: "\"Shoigu, Gerasimov, where the **** are the shells?\""
WGN.15.d: "After countless appeals about ammunition hunger we still receive no answer. Today, after a failed assault, a Wagner group took heavy losses—losses that could have been five times lower had we been given our shell allocation. Enraged, Prigozhin recorded a video standing over the dead. The clip went viral, fuelling righteous anger at the MoD."

WGN.16.t: "Council of commanders decides Wagner’s fate"
WGN.16.d: "Our statutes give no guidance on losing both leaders at once, so the future of the PMC and a new chief must be chosen by the commanders’ council. [WGN_council_commanders_event_AT] Some argue Wagner can never recover from the blow and should be disbanded."

WGN.17.d: "This evening our field camp was hit by rockets. Brothers-in-arms who forged victory for Russia lie dead. The strike came not from the AFU but from the glutted vermin in our own MoD. Shoigu—who deliberately kills Russian soldiers—has committed a monstrous crime. This was the last straw."
WGN.17.a: "Mount up, lads!"

WGN.18.t: "Contract with the Motherland"
WGN.18.d: "After long debate the commanders’ council has agreed to join the Special Military Operation alongside RF Armed Forces and LDNR units. Our best assault groups have completed preparations and are moving to the line. If we must walk into hell, we’ll be the best there."

WGN.20.t: "Bieber and Dolik"
WGN.20.d: "We have handed Bakhmut positions to the RF Armed Forces and pulled the Orchestra back to rear camps. In a video from the city, Prigozhin presented two Wagner assault men—Bieber and Dolik—praising their skill and courage. They will stay in Bakhmut to stop the Ukrainians, since we can’t rely on the MoD."
WGN.20.a: "\"Guys, just don’t rough up the regulars, OK?\""

WGN.21.t: "Bieber is killed"
WGN.21.d: "News has come of the death of Bieber, hero of the popular clip with Prigozhin. He signed a MoD contract and fought on, dying while repelling a Ukrainian attack. Comrades call him a fine commander and true patriot. God takes the best."

WGN.22.t: "AFU strike our HQ in Popasna"
WGN.22.d: "Ukrainian rockets hit our HQ in Popasna. The building is wrecked; there are dead. Luckily Prigozhin had left the day before. The strike was likely guided by a careless Telegram post from war-correspondent Sergey Sreda. We must be more cautious about our locations."

WGN.26.desc: "Evening shrouded Prigozhin’s country house. In his office he leafed through Africa reports when the pale-yellow government phone rang. Lt-Gen Alekseyev from the General Staff spoke: “The front is worsening. We need men who won’t flinch under fire.

WGN.27.t: "Failure of Operation Mongoose Pounce"
WGN.27.desc: "Operation “Mongoose Pounce”, conceived as a swift and decisive strike, has ended in failure. The forces committed suffered heavy losses and the stated objectives were not achieved.

We will not break the laws of humanity. Instead we’ll simply destroy everyone on the battlefield. §RNo more prisoners at all!§!”"
WGN.28.a: "No mercy!"

WGN.29.t: "\"The Orchestra\" gains clout"
WGN.29.desc: "Disciplined, fearless and superbly led, Wagner’s fighters inspire genuine admiration from the Russian people. Telegram posts, songs, fan-art—only a fraction of the groundswell behind our men. While desk generals hide in offices, the “musicians” get the job done—and the nation sees it. No wonder the MoD paper-pushers, with their laughable briefings, are eaten up with envy."

WGN.30.t: "Appeal to the Russian Ministry of Defence"
WGN.30.desc: "We sent a request—and got silence. No answer, no attempt to explain why front-line units go months without shells. Each day without ammunition is a betrayal by those lounging in high posts. We log missed deliveries and broken promises, while artillery crews fire the dregs of their stocks. Do they think you can win a war on paperwork? Their silence makes them accomplices in our casualties."
WGN.30.a: "Vile swine!"

WGN.32.t: "Shell allotment slashed to crumbs"
WGN.32.desc: "Hardly had the General Staff trimmed our ammunition under tales of an “AFU counter-offensive” when a fresh knife arrived: the daily issue per gun has been hacked to a disgraceful minimum—an artillery range gets more! In a fire-barrier doctrine six rounds a day is a sick joke.\n\nOnly one motive fits: the MoD’s jealous courtiers hate Wagner’s growing fame. Prigozhin will contact Gen. Surovikin and demand answers for this sabotage."

WGN.33.desc: "Businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin has admitted he created the group later called “Wagner” back in 2014—his comment appeared on the VK page of his company Concord.\n\n“I, like many businessmen, visited training grounds where ‘Cossacks’ gathered and tried to shower them with money to form a unit to protect Russians. Soon I realised half were swindlers and half took cash, hired volunteers and sent them to certain death in rags,” he said. So he took the matter into his own hands and found real specialists.\n\nPrigozhin added that the unit, first known as the Wagner BTG, appeared on 1 May 2014."
WGN.33.a: "Was anyone in doubt?"
WGN.34.t: "“Chief of the General Staff, you’re a f***ing f****t and a god-damned devil!”"
WGN.34.desc: "A video with exactly this message has gone viral in military Telegram channels: Russian Wagner soldiers cursing out the Chief of the General Staff for the lack of ammunition. Lately some of our units really are starved of supplies, so the soldiers’ anger is entirely justified.\n\nDespite pro-MoD media screaming “Ukrainian psy-ops!”, Yevgeny Viktorovich has confirmed the clip is genuine and stressed that such language is “fair enough when you bury comrades every single day.”\n\nPrigozhin personally visited the position shown in the video, bringing this message:\n— And the lads asked me to add, when you’re sitting in a warm office you don’t hear the front-line problems at all."

We’re sure you have ammo sitting on depots somewhere. But we desperately need it.

Ukraine massed huge forces—tanks, special troops, artillery—under Bakhmut, and we lacked the means to break them. Prigozhin blamed the MoD and General Staff for denying Wagner proper support.

Professionals are either killed in meat-grinder assaults, forced out by their superiors, or left idle for lack of shells.\n\nMizintsev—one of the rare truly competent and dedicated commanders—must not stand aside in Russia’s hour of need.
