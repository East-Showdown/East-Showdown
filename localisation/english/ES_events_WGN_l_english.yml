WGN.37.t: "Putin Comments on Prigozhin’s Statement"
WGN.37.desc: "At the end of his speech at an economic forum in Saint Petersburg, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was asked by Kremlin pool journalists about Prigozhin’s recent appeal. The President gave the following comment::\n\n'You know, Yevgeny Viktorovich is an energetic, patriotic man, and I have known him for a long time. He has done a lot for our country, and his contributions, including those related to the Special Military Operation, are undoubtedly significant. We appreciate this. But as for his letter... I studied it carefully and must say that the accusations made there do not have sufficient grounds. Sergey Kuzhugetovich and Valery Vasilyevich are professionals who have to work in extremely difficult conditions. They do everything possible to provide our troops with everything necessary, and I trust their decisions.\n\nRegarding the shell shortage that Yevgeny Viktorovich talks about so much — this is a complex issue related to objective limitations. We are working on it, and no one is deliberately trying to weaken anyone. After all, our goal is one. I am sure misunderstandings can be resolved in a working manner without unnecessary emotions. Yevgeny Viktorovich is a straightforward man and sometimes speaks sharply, but I believe he does so only out of extreme love for the Motherland. The main thing is to continue working together for victory.'"

WGN.36.desc: "Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, responsible for the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and for months sabotaging Wagner PMC, has resigned voluntarily citing health reasons. The wave of justifiable outrage from patriotic society and our relentless accusations against Shoigu have done their job.\n\nShoigu’s 'achievements' as Defense Minister are truly horrific: corruption, nepotism, the collapse of the MOD apparatus, sabotage of the front for personal interests, the effective failure of the special military operation, massive casualties among Russian troops — the list goes on.\n\nBut most importantly, this scumbag is removed, and he will surely answer for all his deeds — as will Valery Gerasimov, whose competence as Chief of the General Staff is currently under investigation.\n\nThese bastards face only the court of history and universal contempt. For us, the Wagner fighters, there is only to continue fighting for Russia and winning as we know how. The interim Defense Minister, Colonel-General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, has already contacted our commanders to resolve the ammunition crisis and restore supply. The work on the SVO fronts will be tough."

Clearly, the intrigues brewing within the Ministry of Defense could not escape the president’s attention. Now the Supreme Commander has a strong reason to reshuffle the MOD leadership and remove individuals harming the country and the army, particularly those of Tuvan nationality.\n\nThis once again proves that the president is not isolated in an information vacuum and promptly receives all necessary information from various sources.

Medical evacuation of the wounded is almost non-existent. The servicemen expressed unwillingness to continue serving under such conditions and demand to join the 'Orchestra.'

According to him, there was no real threat from Ukraine or NATO in February 2022 — the generals simply fabricated a threat so that the bastard Shoigu could become a Marshal. He asserts that the Ukrainian army had no plans to advance on Donbas, and a global war could have been avoided.\n\nPrigozhin emphasizes that the operation was conducted unprofessionally from the very beginning. The Ministry of Defense was unprepared for real combat. Chaos, lack of strategy, and indifference to soldiers’ fates led to catastrophic losses. Yevgeny Viktorovich is not afraid to name numbers and speak the truth — unlike those hiding behind reports. He openly praises the heroism of the fighters, including ex-convicts he personally recruited who proved their valor in battle and washed away their guilt with blood.\n\nHe highlights the stark contrast between the selflessness of the men on the front lines and the cynical indifference of generals like Shoigu and Gerasimov, clinging to power at the cost of others’ lives. Prigozhin bluntly states that the president often isn’t told the truth — he receives distorted, sugar-coated briefings far from reality.\n\nHis words are not 'outcries' or 'panic,' as Kremlin careerists claim, but a bitter and inconvenient truth for those in power."

The local music group 'Leningrad,' led by Sergey Shnurov, decided to mock the latest failure of the city administration in their characteristic style — releasing two provocative music videos for the songs 'Poka Tak' and 'Pokayannaya.' These videos sarcastically and with strong language ridicule Governor Alexander Beglov’s inability to manage snow and trash removal.\n\nBehind this obvious informational attack on the northern capital’s administration stands none other than Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, whose strained and hostile relations with Beglov stem from a series of business failures, such as the 'Gorskaya' tourist zone project, as well as blocking his candidates in the Legislative Assembly elections.\n\nMoreover, as a sign of gratitude for generous donations to the band and fruitful cooperation, 'Leningrad' composed a personal song for Prigozhin called 'Prigozhin the Chef,' performed in a private circle."

Negotiations broke down — only more volleys followed.\n\nWe temporarily retreated for regrouping near the city of Kashira. There has been no direct contact with Rostov for several hours, mobile internet is jammed in the region, preventing timely intel, and the column continues to be attacked by the Aerospace Forces of the Ministry of Defense.\n\nMorale has sharply dropped. The decisive spirit of the ‘Musicians’ is gone.

According to the agreements reached, rank-and-file soldiers receive amnesty, but this does not extend to the command staff — key company commanders are currently held in FSB detention.\n\nSome fighters who wished to continue fighting the Ukrainians have joined the Ministry of Defense on contract.

WGN.2.d: "After a series of brilliant successes on the Ukrainian front and the rapid growth of PMC Wagner, the General Staff unexpectedly announced a cut in ammunition supplies. The official reason — a possible enemy counteroffensive — sounds like just another bureaucratic excuse. The situation is tough but not critical yet. Our fighters are used to decisive action, not counting every shell. Commanders express bewilderment — why reduce ammo supplies when strategic initiative is shifting in our favor?\n\nWithin Wagner ranks, old tensions with the General Staff are recalled, dating back to Syria in 2018. Back then many felt that poor coordination and bureaucracy at the Ministry of Defense led to significant losses in our ranks. Now fighters are increasingly convinced: the General Staff simply envies Wagner’s combat successes, which overshadow their own negligible achievements. This cut in supplies is seen as yet another petty attempt to throw a wrench in the works."

WGN.3.t: "Open Letter to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin"
WGN.3.d: "Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich,\n\nI, Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, head of the Private Military Company 'Wagner', address you as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with an open letter dictated by dire necessity and a deep sense of responsibility for the fate of our Motherland and its people. My conscience and duty to the fighters who daily sacrifice their lives for Russia do not allow me to remain silent when I witness blatant injustice, betrayal, and criminal negligence that undermine the successful outcome of the Special Military Operation and the future of our state.\n\nFor many months, my fighters and I have faced systematic sabotage by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, particularly by Defense Minister Sergey Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov.\n\nUnder their leadership, the Ministry of Defense has systematically sabotaged the supply of ammunition to PMC Wagner, forcing our fighters to storm enemy positions without proper artillery support, even as warehouses overflow with shells. Their incompetent leadership not only slows down our progress but results in the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and volunteers — a level of negligence that borders on treason. Russian men, the best sons of the Fatherland, are dying not so much due to enemy actions, but due to a lack of resources, poor coordination, and senseless orders — a situation that can be rightly described as genocide against the Russian people. Additionally, rampant corruption, lack of discipline, cronyism, and the thirst for personal gain — all tolerated by the aforementioned individuals — are morally decaying the army and leading it toward self-destruction.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, I appeal to you as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, as the democratically elected President of Russia: investigate this situation. Review the actions of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. Find out why your direct orders are not being fulfilled and are being sabotaged. Remove Shoigu and Gerasimov from army leadership. Let us fight for Russia the way we know how — with full dedication and without interference from rear-line intrigue.\n\nI believe in your resolve and in your unwillingness to let the personal interests of a few individuals endanger the interests of the state. For Russia, for our fighters, for victory — take action.\nWith respect and hope for justice,\nYevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin"

WGN.14.d: "Horrifying news has come from the Tver region – the personal plane of our PMC's leader has crashed over Kuzhenkino. According to Rosaviatsiya, the main figures of Wagner – Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin – were on board. Their closest associates report that it is impossible to reach or contact them. Although the bodies have not yet been identified, it can already be said with certainty and deepest sorrow that Dima and Zhenya have perished. It is absolutely clear who organized the murder of the greatest patriots of our Motherland. It was the gravest mistake to make any deals with the Russian political leadership, and that mistake cost us our greatest commanders, without whom Wagner is now decapitated. We should never have trusted those bald rats!"

WGN.15.d: "After many appeals to the Ministry of Defense about the shell shortage, we received absolutely no coherent response. We continue to be ignored. And meanwhile, the war goes on.\n\nToday, after a failed assault, one of our units suffered significant losses that could have been reduced fivefold, or even more, if we had been provided with the proper ammunition quota. Prigozhin, who had to see a pile of Wagner 200s with his own eyes, was enraged and decided to express himself emotionally, recording it on video.\n\nThe video, published by the press service, instantly spread across the internet, sparking justified public outrage and questions for the leadership of the Ministry of Defense."

[WGN_council_commanders_event_AT] Alternatively, the council may remain the primary governing body of Wagner, allowing us to jointly decide operational matters through meetings. However, many agree that the 'Musicians', now decapitated, will never recover from the loss of Prigozhin and Utkin, and therefore, the best course may be to cease all PMC activity. So, based on the council's conclusion..."

The strike was not carried out by the AFU, as we initially thought, but by the gluttonous bastards from our own Ministry of Defense. Shoigu, who deliberately kills Russian soldiers, has committed a monstrous crime against Russia, and no one intends to stop him.

At the end of the video, Prigozhin introduced two Wagner assault troops – Bieber and Dolik – highlighting their professionalism and courage. They will remain in Bakhmut to stop the Ukrainian Army in case of an offensive, since we currently cannot rely on the Russian Armed Forces."

WGN.21.d: "We have received information about the death of the hero from the popular video with Prigozhin, the Wagner fighter with the call sign 'Bieber'. He signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense and remained on the front line, bravely fighting Ukrainian Nazis until he was killed repelling a Ukrainian assault.

Fortunately, Yevgeny Viktorovich was not present during the strike. Though Prigozhin had visited the HQ the day before, so we were extremely lucky.

On the massive oak desk lay papers marked with notes, and beside them, a cup of strong black coffee still steamed. Prigozhin, dressed in a dark sweater, with a tired but focused gaze, was reviewing tedious reports about the latest operations of his Wagner PMC on the African continent.\n\nSuddenly, the silence was shattered by the sharp ring of a telephone — an old-fashioned device with a pale yellow receiver. A government line.\n\nPrigozhin slowly picked up the handset, squinting as if he already sensed that this call would change everything. On the other end was a low, commanding voice — the voice of a military man used to giving orders.\n\n— Yevgeny Viktorovich, good evening. General-Lieutenant Alekseyev, General Staff. We have an urgent matter.\n\nPrigozhin leaned back in his chair. He remained silent, waiting, but already felt the familiar fire kindling in his chest — the anticipation of a big game.\n\n— The situation at the front is deteriorating, — Alekseyev continued. His voice lowered slightly, but remained firm. — We need experienced men who won’t flinch under fire. We’re counting on you and your unit."

Telegram posts, songs, fan art featuring the 'musicians' — these are just a fraction of the powerful popular support our fighters receive daily. Wagner is gradually becoming the main driving force of Russia on the Ukrainian front, showing results where others fail.\n\nIt’s no surprise that this state of affairs provokes irritation and bitter envy among the MoD bureaucrats, whose daily reports and pompous briefings evoke nothing but laughter and shame.

Every day without shells is a betrayal committed by those in high-ranking positions at the Russian MoD. We are documenting failed deliveries, broken agreements, while they pretend nothing is happening. Our artillerymen are firing with what's left in storage.

And now, another stab in the back: the ammo ration has been cut to such a disgraceful minimum that we can confidently say — even a training range is better supplied! Under a fire barrage tactic, where the enemy must be overwhelmed with a storm of shells, six shells per day per artillery position is considered the norm by the General Staff.\n\nOne thing is certain — behind such decisions are the selfish motives of the 'military bureaucracy', unhappy with the growing influence and popularity of Wagner.
