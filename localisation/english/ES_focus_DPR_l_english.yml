DPR_dark_clouds_over_donbass: "Dark Clouds over Donbas..."
DPR_dark_clouds_over_donbass_desc: "In 2014, as the treacherous Euromaidan began, the heroic people of Donbas chose their future and took up arms against the Kyiv regime. Together our young republics defended their independence, pledging loyalty to their true Motherland—Russia! During the Russian Spring we paid dearly for Bandera’s aggression, yet held our right to self-determination. Eight years on, storm clouds gather again. We are sure Ukraine will try another strike to break Novorossiya. To prevent our destruction and win our place in Russia, we must prepare to repel aggression and liberate our land. For the Motherland! For Donbas!"

DPR_preparations_day_and_night: "Preparing for the Inevitable"
DPR_preparations_day_and_night_desc: "Eight years of war taught us Kyiv will never abandon its dream of seizing Donbas and forcing Bandera’s ideology on our people. War today will be nothing like 2014: the AFU is stronger, while Russia’s manoeuvres hint at a final battle. We shall secure our industry, ready the DPR armed forces, study past victories—Ilovaisk, Debaltseve, Donetsk Airport—and, if needed, call on our great Motherland’s help."

DPR_war_on_the_horizon: "War on the Horizon"
DPR_war_on_the_horizon_desc: "Intelligence confirms full-scale Ukrainian aggression is near. Kyiv masses troops along our borders; Russia deploys a vast grouping with clear objectives. To aid Russia we will have the General Staff draft large-scale defensive and offensive plans, coordinate with Moscow and the LNR, and perhaps strike pre-emptively to secure our sovereignty."

DPR_remind_the_russian_spring: "Remember the Russian Spring"
DPR_remind_the_russian_spring_desc: "On the eve of a new war we recall the valor of our militia who defended the DPR in 2014-15. Their courage was key to our freedom. Today, as threat returns, their deeds must inspire us to new victories against Ukrainian nationalists."

DPR_find_the_ammunition_for_our_soldiers: "Equip Our Boys"
DPR_find_the_ammunition_for_our_soldiers_desc: "Our troops will soon face the AFU again. To defeat the enemy we must purchase and request large quantities of weapons from Russia—without proper arms our men cannot prevail."

DPR_mobolize_transport: "Mobilise Civil Transport"
DPR_mobolize_transport_desc: "General mobilisation swelled the People’s Militia, yet our motor pool suits a militia, not an army. We’ll requisition vehicles from state enterprises, and volunteers will bring personal cars and 4×4s to keep infantry brigades moving."

DPR_repair_the_remnants_of_tanks: "Refurbish Stored Armour"
DPR_repair_the_remnants_of_tanks_desc: "Our forces field 480+ tanks, 914 AFVs, 720 guns and over 200 MLRS. We can still restore damaged vehicles, reinforcing the army with proven—but rebuilt—hardware."

DPR_general_moblization: "General Mobilisation"
DPR_general_moblization_desc: "Front-line pressure grows. As in the Great Patriotic War, the whole nation must unite. We declare general mobilisation: reserves will form, veterans regroup. Training time is short—recruits learn only the basics, so guard them well. Truth is strength, and strength brings victory."

DPR_prepare_the_mgb: "Ready the MGB"
DPR_prepare_the_mgb_desc: "In wartime the Ministry of State Security is vital for counter-terrorism, counter-intelligence and defence against external threats. We will upgrade its technical base, expand investigative powers and create specialised units."

DPR_not_fallen_republic: "The Republic Still Stands"
DPR_not_fallen_republic_desc: "The DPR declared independence on 12 May 2014 and, against great odds, survived Kyiv’s onslaught. Eight harsh years followed—economic collapse, constant shelling—yet we stabilised and rose again. Freedom is never permanent; a new battle looms and we shall defend our right to exist."

DPR_strenghten_the_roadblocks: "Reinforce Roadblocks"
DPR_strenghten_the_roadblocks_desc: "Since 2014 we have retreated ever closer to Russia’s border. To avoid further losses we’ll build new checkpoints and upgrade old ones, fortify trenches, deploy obstacles, enhance surveillance and train troops in defensive tactics."

DPR_evacuate_the_people: "Evacuate Civilians"
DPR_evacuate_the_people_desc: "Two million people reside in our land, most civilians. To spare them the coming storm we will evacuate them to Russia, where several regions stand ready to provide shelter and aid."
DPR_fight_the_saboteurs: "Hunt the Saboteurs"
DPR_fight_the_saboteurs_desc: "During Kyiv’s so-called “ATO”, the people of Donbas learned all they needed about Ukraine’s intentions. Yet sympathisers remain inside the Republic. SBU and HUR assets take many forms: from pro-Ukrainian ‘waiters’ longing for Kyiv’s return to trained diversionary groups tasked with wrecking logistics, demoralising our troops and destroying our statehood. Once full-scale confrontation begins, they will try to activate every network across Novorossiya. To safeguard the Republic we must order the MGB to seek out the enemies of the Motherland. They will either serve the Republic—or fall silent forever!"

DPR_strenghten_the_patrols: "Reinforce Patrols"
DPR_strenghten_the_patrols_desc: "War looms closer than ever. We must launch specialised courses and drills for patrol units, tighten audits and reporting, and—crucially—request modern Russian equipment to improve monitoring and rapid response."

DPR_on_high_alert: "Full Combat Readiness"
DPR_on_high_alert_desc: "With our preparations complete, the Republic must move to full alert. From government offices to ordinary citizens, everyone must know the border situation and be ready to defend our land. Final mobilisation steps, moral briefings for the troops and a reminder of the ultimate goal—re-unification with Russia—are due now."

DPR_warriors_from_the_east: "Warriors from the East"
DPR_warriors_from_the_east_desc: "Eight years of struggle against the Kyiv junta nearly quenched our hope for a just, flourishing Russian World. Today our brothers from Russia have officially stepped in: the Special Military Operation will end the genocide of the Russian people and restore justice. The DPR People’s Militia marches alongside these eastern bogatyrs. Together we will smash the Banderite occupiers of Novorossiya and bring them to rightful judgement."

DPR_cooperate_with_russian_goverment: "Coordinate with the Russian Government"
DPR_cooperate_with_russian_goverment_desc: "To realise our plan we must fuse efforts with our Russian colleagues: discuss the operational situation in Luhansk, align the deployment of joint forces on the border with the Banderite regime, and craft a plan to keep our liberation strategy from enemy ears."

DPR_expand_the_FSB_contacts: "Expand the FSB Liaison Staff"
DPR_expand_the_FSB_contacts_desc: "To thwart leaks and frustrate SBU intel-gathering, we shall enlarge the cadre of FSB overseers. A stronger counter-intelligence screen will neutralise leaks and root out Banderite spies."

DPR_coordinate_with_VS_RF: "Synchronise with the Russian General Staff"
DPR_coordinate_with_VS_RF_desc: "For the coming offensive we must align assault plans, tactics and objectives with the Russian General Staff. Our military experts will travel to Moscow to begin detailed coordination and final troop preparations."
#Ветка на войну
 DPR_kalash_again_in_the_hands: "The ‘Kalash’ Back in Our Soldiers’ Hands ..."
 DPR_kalash_again_in_the_hands_desc: "Once again our fighters grip a Kalashnikov. For decades this weapon has been a symbol of resilience and invincibility. Simple, reliable and always ready, it stands beside our defenders in the harshest conditions. The “Kalash” is more than a rifle; it is a legend—a badge of courage and faith in victory. With it our heroes shield the homeland, confident they can safeguard freedom and independence."
 DPR_together_with_russian_soldiers: "Side-by-Side with Russia’s Soldiers!"
 DPR_together_with_russian_soldiers_desc: "We stand with those who fight for truth. Russian soldiers are not merely allies — they are brothers-in-arms, shoulder to shoulder with us in trenches and at checkpoints.\nOne line, one aim, one victory. We cannot be broken, for we are united!"

 DPR_defence_the_communications: "Shield the Supply Lines"
 DPR_defence_the_communications_desc: "Supply routes, depots, railways, power plants — these are the war’s arteries, and the enemy longs to sever them.\nWe will not allow it. Strong defences, tight control and layered security ensure every resource reaches the front on time.\nThe lifeblood of victory will flow without interruption!"

 DPR_Joint_meetings_with_the_General_Staff_of_the_VSRF: "Joint Sessions with the RF General Staff"
 DPR_Joint_meetings_with_the_General_Staff_of_the_VSRF_desc: "Victory favours the well-coordinated. Our commanders now sit with the Russian General Staff, taking decisions that shape the battle.\nExperience, technology and strategy operate at the highest level — a true combat synergy where everyone knows his role and performs without error."

 DPR_Donbass_behind_us: "“Donbass Is With Us!”"
 DPR_Donbass_behind_us_desc: "This land has endured too much to fall again. Donbass means unbroken spirit, miners’ grit and a will forged by hardship.\nThe people know struggle — and who stands with them in dark hours. Support from Russia and the DPR is proven in deeds, not words.\nDonbass stood, stands and will stand!"

 DPR_Lessons_from_the_first_months: "Lessons of the Opening Months"
 DPR_Lessons_from_the_first_months_desc: "Several months of the Special Military Operation have shown our original plans were doomed to fail; new tactics are essential.\nArmoured thrusts seized ground quickly, yet the “column tactic” faltered once Ukraine held firm and counter-attacked.\nWe have refocused on Novorossiya and studied Ukraine’s “fortress-city” defence — Bakhmut an emblem. Encircle and annihilate such pockets!\nFinally, we must abandon hopes of a swift end. The blitz has stalled; surprise is gone, and a long war of attrition awaits."
