che.1.t: "The Situation in Chechnya in 2022"
che.1.desc: "By January 2022, the Chechen Republic presents itself as one of the most stable and loyal subjects of the Russian Federation, shaped through the complex post-Soviet transformation and two devastating military campaigns. Thanks to a strategic alliance with the federal center and the personal trust of President Vladimir Putin in Ramzan Kadyrov, the region has transformed from a conflict zone into a stronghold of federal authority in the North Caucasus.\n\nChechnya demonstrates a model of full integration into Moscow’s political vertical. There is no serious opposition in the republic, and the security and administrative structures are under strict control. Kadyrov's army, informally known as the 'Kadyrovtsy,' consists of tens of thousands of fighters and functions as a regional guard — capable of operating both within and beyond the republic. Its fighters have actively participated in campaigns in Syria, the Donbas, as well as in maintaining internal security during crisis management operations in neighboring regions.\n\nThe Chechen governance model is based on a symbiosis of Islamic tradition, clan loyalty, and centralized authoritarianism. Against the backdrop of growing turbulence in other parts of Russia, the republic maintains a demonstrative stability. Social programs, large-scale construction, media presence, and the personality cult of the regional leader — all contribute to strengthening Chechnya’s image as the 'new showcase of Russia.'\n\nThe republic actively positions itself not only as a political ally, but also as an ideological stronghold of Russian statehood. Amid rising anti-Russian sentiment globally and escalating conflict with the West, Chechnya is ready once again to prove its combat readiness — both through strength and loyalty. For in Grozny, they know well: loyalty is proven not by words, but by deeds."
che.1.a: "Akhmat is power! Russia is might! Allahu Akbar!"

che.2.t: "The Duty of the Chechen People"
che.2.desc: "A large gathering took place in Grozny, where more than 12,000 fighters expressed their full readiness to carry out tasks of any complexity at the order of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, President Vladimir Putin. Many of them also expressed their desire to volunteer for deployment to Ukraine.\n\n'By the way, regarding the situation in Ukraine, we can see that many terrorists have found refuge there. Among them are those who, in the Chechen Republic, killed our brothers, sisters, women, children, and the elderly, and later fled from justice to Europe under the protection of various intelligence agencies.\n\nI officially declare that the hottest spots in Ukraine will be taken by Chechen fighters who follow the path of the First President of the Chechen Republic, Hero of Russia Akhmat-Khadzhi Kadyrov. I’ve seen some videos where nationalists challenge them. I declare: if you want to meet us, we gladly invite you to do so there.\n\nI am confident that in the coming days we will celebrate the liberation of the millions of people of Ukraine from violence and killings. And I also appeal to the still-President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky: call the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and ask for forgiveness. Do it to preserve Ukraine and its people. Accept all the conditions demanded by Russia — that will be the right step to save your face.'\n\n— stated the Head of the Republic, Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov."
che.2.a: "Praise be to Allah! Long live Russia!"

che.3.t: "The Kadyrov Personality Cult"
che.3.desc: "The people of Chechnya have always been devoted to their leaders—yet never as much as to Akhmat and Ramzan Kadyrov. Akhmat Kadyrov, father of the current head of the republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was the first president and, in effect, the architect of modern Chechnya; he played a major role in the federal victory in the Second Chechen War. Having done much to restore peace, he paid with his life: in 2004 Akhmat was killed in a terrorist attack in Grozny claimed by militants led by Shamil Basayev. After his death Ramzan became president, portraits of Akhmat were hung across state and public buildings, and in 2005 a monument to him was erected in Grozny’s main square.\n The cult remains strong today: Chechen flags often feature images of Ramzan or Akhmat, and the republic’s special-forces unit is named after the elder Kadyrov."
che.3.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.4.t: "Our Army"
che.4.desc: "New units will be created, forged by rigorous training and modern strategy. They will strengthen the army, raise combat effectiveness and safeguard our interests on every front."
che.4.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.20.t: "Kadyrov’s Bastions"
che.20.desc: "Power, strength and loyalty—the three pillars of this bastion. Here the army is not merely a tool but a symbol of policy and unity. Friendship with Moscow cements our position, while strategy and military might define the future."
che.20.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.20.t: "Aid from the Persian Gulf States"
che.20.desc: "Allies from the Middle East extend a helping hand! Financial assistance, arms supplies and strategic cooperation will reinforce our position and open new opportunities for the development of our army and policy."
che.20.a: "We will never forget the help of our brothers!"

che.22.t: "Conflict with Russian Oligarchs"

che.23.a: "Tell the President he agrees!"

che.24.t: "Putin Agrees!"

che.24.a: "Another victory for us!"

che.25.t: "Redemption of 'Bandera'"
che.25.desc: "'Freedom or death.' How many times has this slogan been used to manipulate people throughout different eras! How many lives were ruined! How much destruction and pain it has brought! Chechens are all too familiar with this motto today. Not only the memories are fresh, but also the bitter aftertaste of those calls for either freedom or death. Yet death is inevitable anyway — but what was the proclaimed freedom really about?\n\nDEAR BROTHER Khusein Djambetov is one of those who, for many years during the period of Ichkeria, was a fervent supporter of the slogan 'Freedom or death', and after that lived abroad and continued his propaganda work. He recently returned to Grozny and admitted that he had been deeply mistaken. I saw him on Friday after the Jumu'ah prayer and spoke with him. I asked him, what was the limit of that freedom that the Ichkerians shouted about and used to cloud people’s minds? What did that freedom mean to them? Freedom to visit mosques and observe the requirements of the Quran and Sunnah? There are no restrictions here. The recitation of the Quran can be heard not only inside homes and religious institutions but also in the streets. Access to medicine, education, sports? Please — all doors are open! No barriers. Maybe, by shouting about freedom, the supporters of Ichkeria were concerned with preserving Chechen traditions, customs, and language? But even here, we not only carry out constant work, we have also established entire specialized institutes aimed at fulfilling these tasks. So what is the problem?\n\nKhusein came to the same conclusions. He returned and asked the people for forgiveness for his false notions of freedom and the mistakes he had made. Whatever the case, it is already good if even one person realizes before the end of his days that he was mistaken. That is my opinion."
che.25.a: "Akhmat is power!"

che.26.t: "Chechnya with the President"
che.26.desc: "Friends, the night was difficult, and the flights left no time to voice my position on this vile TREACHERY!\n\nWhat is happening is a STAB IN THE BACK and a real military mutiny!\n\nI have warned more than once that war is not the time to voice personal grievances or settle disputes in our rear. The rear must always remain calm and reliable. Imagine what the guys in the trenches are feeling now, with the enemy in front of them and a treacherous adventure behind their backs. This is about stability, national unity, and the safety of our citizens.\n\nWe have a Supreme Commander-in-Chief, elected by the people, who knows the entire situation down to the smallest detail better than any strategist, and certainly better than any businessman. He personally calls commanders 'on the ground' and fully controls the course of the Special Military Operation. The decisions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief are made deliberately and meticulously. Each of us sees only a part of the map, while he sees it all! And Vladimir Vladimirovich rightly noted in his address to the nation – this is a military mutiny! There is no justification for such actions!\nI fully support every word of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!\n\nFighters of the Ministry of Defense and the National Guard in the Chechen Republic have already departed for tension zones. We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood!"
che.26.a: "The mutiny must be crushed"

che.27.t: "'Akhmat' Approaches Rostov"
che.27.desc: "The 'Akhmat' special forces column has entered the Rostov region from the SMO zone to restore order. The unit is stationed in the Aksay area, 7 km from Rostov-on-Don, and is on full combat readiness. We await orders from the command, and as soon as they are given, we will begin clearing the city of the bandit groups of the traitor Prigozhin."
che.27.a: "Allahu Akbar!"

che.28.t: "Arrest of Zarema Muzaeva"
che.28.desc: "Our valiant law enforcement officers carried out a model operation and delivered Zarema Muzaeva — the wife of former Supreme Court judge of the Chechen Republic Saidi Yangulbaev — to Grozny. The arrest was conducted strictly according to the law, despite resistance and petty provocations from her family. Zarema Muzaeva is accused of fraud and embezzlement, which became the basis for her arrest.\n\nThe Yangulbaev family has long been known for its destructive activities: its members, hiding outside the Russian Federation, regularly spread lies and slander about our republic and its leadership, particularly about Hero of Russia Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov. These actions aim to undermine peace and harmony in society. Law enforcement agencies will continue to decisively suppress such actions."
che.28.a: "Enemies of Chechnya will find no refuge!"

che.29.t: "Chechen security forces arrested Zarema Muzaeva"
che.29.desc: "On January 21, officers of the security structures of the Chechen Republic conducted an operation in Nizhny Novgorod and brought Zarema Muzaeva, wife of former Supreme Court judge of Chechnya Saidi Yangulbaev, to Grozny. The basis for her detention was an investigation into a criminal case on fraud and embezzlement. According to reports, the security forces acted decisively, using force to place the woman into the service vehicle, despite her family's resistance.\n\nThe Yangulbaev family has long been under the scrutiny of law enforcement agencies. Two of her sons, having left Chechnya, actively make sharp statements online against the republic's leadership. Their activities are closely linked to other opposition structures: Ibrahim Yangulbaev is considered one of the founders of the 'Adat' movement, spreading protest ideas on social media, while Abubakar Yangulbaev is a lawyer and human rights defender with the 'Committee Against Torture', which has long been in conflict with Chechen leadership.\n\nThe 'Committee Against Torture' is a Russian human rights organization that investigates cases of torture and abuse of power by security structures. In the North Caucasus, this organization has been actively working since the early 2000s, documenting victim testimonies and representing them in court. At the same time, the committee closely cooperates with several Western NGOs, receiving grants and support from abroad, making it primarily a tool of politically motivated anti-Russian pressure."
che.29.a: "We leave this to the competence of Chechen authorities"

che.30.t: "Ibrahim Yangulbaev declared federally wanted"
che.30.desc: "The Visaitovsky District Court of Grozny, in absentia, chose arrest as a preventive measure against Ibrahim Saidayevich Yangulbaev on a criminal case under Part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation 'Public calls for terrorist activities'. As a result, he was declared federally wanted. The valiant officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic are conducting a set of operational-search measures to locate and apprehend the fugitive. According to the Chechen Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ibrahim Yangulbaev is linked to the Telegram channel 1ADAT, materials of which have been recognized as extremist in absentia. He is reported to be hiding abroad.\n\nMeanwhile, the district court of Grozny sentenced Zarema Muzaeva to 15 days of administrative arrest on charges of 'petty hooliganism' (Part 1, Article 20.1 of the Administrative Offenses Code). According to law enforcement, during her transportation to Grozny, she attacked a police officer. Her husband Saidi Yangulbaev and daughter Aliya left Russia."
che.30.a: "All who dared offend the honor of the Chechen people will be destroyed!"

che.31.t: "The Chechen people outraged by the Yangulbaev family!"
che.31.desc: "Today, mass protests against the Yangulbaev family took place in Grozny and other cities of the Chechen Republic, whose immoral activities caused unprecedented outrage among Chechen society. Thousands of citizens gathered in squares with posters and slogans, expressing anger and demanding justice.\n\nThe Head of Chechnya and Hero of Russia Ramzan Kadyrov expressed his opinion, calling the protesters true defenders of Islam and stating that every one of their actions 'was done on the path of gazavat'. The head of the republic declared that all who have ever tried to sow discord in Chechen society 'met the same fate.' 'And the same fate awaits everyone who dares to challenge our peace, our religion, our honor, and our harmony,' Kadyrov emphasized."
che.31.a: "The Chechen people have FOREVER cursed that damn family!"

che.32.t: "Message to the so-called 'human rights defenders'"
che.32.desc: "We have always destroyed terrorists and their accomplices, among whom there is no difference, and will continue to do so. We have cleansed our land of them and now relentlessly fight them wherever they may be. Pursuing this evil has cost the lives of thousands of worthy sons among the Chechens. They did not give their lives for the vile Yangulbaev family to undo all the achievements with their provocations and intrigues.\n\nThe true embodiment of betrayal is Yangulbaev Sr. Calling himself a judge, he failed to raise cultured children. And instead of condemning them for extremist statements, he betrayed the judicial system, supported them, and fled, hiding behind the status of a judge.\n\nFor me, the terrorists also include Kalyapin and Milashina, who profit from the topic of the Chechen Republic and its people, creating scenarios and whispering texts and behaviors into the ears of their characters. If there is law and law enforcement in Russia, I address them: arrest these accomplices of terrorists. The evidentiary base is in the materials of journalistic investigations on independent channels.\n\nI also see that some media and bloggers extract certain quotes from my previous statements and improvise with them. Remember once and for all: Kadyrov does not back down from his words and does not speak them in vain. For you, I repeat once again: wherever the Yangulbaevs flee, wherever they are, we will do everything on our side to find them according to the law, and if they resist, they will be destroyed. And do not look for hidden meanings in these words. I repeat for the hard of hearing: everything will be according to the law."
che.32.a: "Akhmat is power!"
