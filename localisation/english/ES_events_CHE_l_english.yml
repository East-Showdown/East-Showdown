che.1.t: "The Situation in Chechnya in 2022"
che.1.desc: "By January 2022, the Chechen Republic presents itself as one of the most stable and loyal subjects of the Russian Federation, shaped through the complex post-Soviet transformation and two devastating military campaigns. Thanks to a strategic alliance with the federal center and the personal trust of President Vladimir Putin in Ramzan Kadyrov, the region has transformed from a conflict zone into a stronghold of federal authority in the North Caucasus.\n\nChechnya demonstrates a model of full integration into Moscow’s political vertical. There is no serious opposition in the republic, and the security and administrative structures are under strict control. Kadyrov's army, informally known as the 'Kadyrovtsy,' consists of tens of thousands of fighters and functions as a regional guard — capable of operating both within and beyond the republic. Its fighters have actively participated in campaigns in Syria, the Donbas, as well as in maintaining internal security during crisis management operations in neighboring regions.\n\nThe Chechen governance model is based on a symbiosis of Islamic tradition, clan loyalty, and centralized authoritarianism. Against the backdrop of growing turbulence in other parts of Russia, the republic maintains a demonstrative stability. Social programs, large-scale construction, media presence, and the personality cult of the regional leader — all contribute to strengthening Chechnya’s image as the 'new showcase of Russia.'\n\nThe republic actively positions itself not only as a political ally, but also as an ideological stronghold of Russian statehood. Amid rising anti-Russian sentiment globally and escalating conflict with the West, Chechnya is ready once again to prove its combat readiness — both through strength and loyalty. For in Grozny, they know well: loyalty is proven not by words, but by deeds."
che.1.a: "Akhmat is power! Russia is might! Allahu Akbar!"

che.3.t: "The Kadyrov Personality Cult"
che.3.desc: "The people of Chechnya have always been devoted to their leaders—yet never as much as to Akhmat and Ramzan Kadyrov. Akhmat Kadyrov, father of the current head of the republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was the first president and, in effect, the architect of modern Chechnya; he played a major role in the federal victory in the Second Chechen War. Having done much to restore peace, he paid with his life: in 2004 Akhmat was killed in a terrorist attack in Grozny claimed by militants led by Shamil Basayev. After his death Ramzan became president, portraits of Akhmat were hung across state and public buildings, and in 2005 a monument to him was erected in Grozny’s main square.\n The cult remains strong today: Chechen flags often feature images of Ramzan or Akhmat, and the republic’s special-forces unit is named after the elder Kadyrov."

che.4.t: "Our Army"

che.25.t: "The Redemption of “Bandera”"
che.25.desc: "\"Freedom or death.\" Throughout history this slogan has been used to manipulate people, leaving ruined lives and untold suffering in its wake—and Chechens know it all too well. The memories and the bitter aftertaste of those cries for freedom are still fresh. Yet death is inevitable, and what was that proclaimed freedom really worth?\n\nDEAR BROTHER Huseyn Zhambetov was for many years, during the time of Ichkeria, an ardent supporter of the “Freedom or death” slogan; even while abroad he continued his agitation. Recently he returned to Grozny and admitted he had been profoundly mistaken. I met him on Friday after the ruzba-namaz and spoke with him. I asked where the limits lay to that freedom about which the Ichkerians had shouted so loudly, clouding people’s minds. What did that freedom mean to them? Freedom to attend mosques and follow the Qur’an and the Sunnah? There is no ban here. The Qur’an is heard in our republic not only inside homes and religious institutions but out on the streets. Access to medical care, education, sport? Please—every door is open, no barriers. Perhaps, in shouting for freedom, the Ichkerians were worried about preserving Chechen traditions, customs and language? Yet here too we not only work everywhere but have whole institutes dedicated to those tasks. So what was the problem?\n\nHuseyn reached the same conclusions. He returned and asked the people to forgive him for his false ideas of freedom and the mistakes he had made. Whatever the case, it is good when even one person, before the end of his days, realises he was mistaken. That is my opinion."
che.25.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.26.t: "Chechnya Stands with the President"
che.26.desc: "Friends, the night was difficult and flights left no time to state my position on this vile BETRAYAL!\n\nEverything that is happening is a DAGGER IN THE BACK—a real military mutiny!\n\nI have repeatedly warned that war is no time to voice personal grievances or settle scores in our rear. The rear must always be calm and reliable. Imagine what the guys in the trenches feel right now: the enemy in front of them and, behind them, a treacherous adventure. This is about stability, the unity of the state and the safety of citizens.\n\nWe have a Supreme Commander-in-Chief, elected by the people, who knows the situation down to the smallest detail better than any strategist or, especially, any businessman, personally phones the commanders “on the ground” and fully controls the course of the SMO. The Commander-in-Chief’s decisions are made carefully and meticulously. Each of us sees only one part of the map, while he sees it all! And, as Vladimir Vladimirovich correctly stated in his address to the nation—this is a military mutiny! There can be no justification for such actions!\n\nI fully support every word of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!\n\nMinistry of Defence troops and National Guard units from the Chechen Republic have already headed to the hotspots. We will do everything to preserve Russia’s unity and protect its statehood!"
che.26.a: "The mutiny must be crushed"

che.27.t: "“Akhmat” Approaches Rostov"
che.27.desc: "An \"Akhmat\" special-forces column has entered Rostov Oblast from the SMO zone to restore order. The unit is deployed near Aksay—seven kilometres from Rostov-on-Don—and is at full combat readiness. We await orders from the command; once they arrive, we will begin clearing the city of the bandit formations of the traitor Prigozhin."
che.27.a: "Allahu Akbar!"
