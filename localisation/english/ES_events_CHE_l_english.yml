che.1.t: "The Situation in Chechnya in 2022"
che.1.desc: "By January 2022, the Chechen Republic presents itself as one of the most stable and loyal subjects of the Russian Federation, shaped through the complex post-Soviet transformation and two devastating military campaigns. Thanks to a strategic alliance with the federal center and the personal trust of President Vladimir Putin in Ramzan Kadyrov, the region has transformed from a conflict zone into a stronghold of federal authority in the North Caucasus.\n\nChechnya demonstrates a model of full integration into Moscow’s political vertical. There is no serious opposition in the republic, and the security and administrative structures are under strict control. Kadyrov's army, informally known as the 'Kadyrovtsy,' consists of tens of thousands of fighters and functions as a regional guard — capable of operating both within and beyond the republic. Its fighters have actively participated in campaigns in Syria, the Donbas, as well as in maintaining internal security during crisis management operations in neighboring regions.\n\nThe Chechen governance model is based on a symbiosis of Islamic tradition, clan loyalty, and centralized authoritarianism. Against the backdrop of growing turbulence in other parts of Russia, the republic maintains a demonstrative stability. Social programs, large-scale construction, media presence, and the personality cult of the regional leader — all contribute to strengthening Chechnya’s image as the 'new showcase of Russia.'\n\nThe republic actively positions itself not only as a political ally, but also as an ideological stronghold of Russian statehood. Amid rising anti-Russian sentiment globally and escalating conflict with the West, Chechnya is ready once again to prove its combat readiness — both through strength and loyalty. For in Grozny, they know well: loyalty is proven not by words, but by deeds."
che.1.a: "Akhmat is power! Russia is might! Allahu Akbar!"

che.3.t: "The Kadyrov Personality Cult"
che.3.desc: "The people of Chechnya have always been devoted to their leaders—yet never as much as to Akhmat and Ramzan Kadyrov. Akhmat Kadyrov, father of the current head of the republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was the first president and, in effect, the architect of modern Chechnya; he played a major role in the federal victory in the Second Chechen War. Having done much to restore peace, he paid with his life: in 2004 Akhmat was killed in a terrorist attack in Grozny claimed by militants led by Shamil Basayev. After his death Ramzan became president, portraits of Akhmat were hung across state and public buildings, and in 2005 a monument to him was erected in Grozny’s main square.\n The cult remains strong today: Chechen flags often feature images of Ramzan or Akhmat, and the republic’s special-forces unit is named after the elder Kadyrov."
che.3.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.4.t: "Our Army"
che.4.desc: "New units will be created, forged by rigorous training and modern strategy. They will strengthen the army, raise combat effectiveness and safeguard our interests on every front."
che.4.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.20.t: "Kadyrov’s Bastions"
che.20.desc: "Power, strength and loyalty—the three pillars of this bastion. Here the army is not merely a tool but a symbol of policy and unity. Friendship with Moscow cements our position, while strategy and military might define the future."
che.20.a: "Akhmat is Power!"

che.20.t: "Aid from the Persian Gulf States"
che.20.desc: "Allies from the Middle East extend a helping hand! Financial assistance, arms supplies and strategic cooperation will reinforce our position and open new opportunities for the development of our army and policy."

che.24.a: "Another victory for us!"

che.25.t: "Redemption of 'Bandera'"
che.25.desc: "'Freedom or death.' How many times has this slogan been used to manipulate people throughout different eras! How many lives were ruined! How much destruction and pain it has brought! Chechens are all too familiar with this motto today. Not only the memories are fresh, but also the bitter aftertaste of those calls for either freedom or death. Yet death is inevitable anyway — but what was the proclaimed freedom really about?\n\nDEAR BROTHER Khusein Djambetov is one of those who, for many years during the period of Ichkeria, was a fervent supporter of the slogan 'Freedom or death', and after that lived abroad and continued his propaganda work. He recently returned to Grozny and admitted that he had been deeply mistaken. I saw him on Friday after the Jumu'ah prayer and spoke with him. I asked him, what was the limit of that freedom that the Ichkerians shouted about and used to cloud people’s minds? What did that freedom mean to them? Freedom to visit mosques and observe the requirements of the Quran and Sunnah? There are no restrictions here. The recitation of the Quran can be heard not only inside homes and religious institutions but also in the streets. Access to medicine, education, sports? Please — all doors are open! No barriers. Maybe, by shouting about freedom, the supporters of Ichkeria were concerned with preserving Chechen traditions, customs, and language? But even here, we not only carry out constant work, we have also established entire specialized institutes aimed at fulfilling these tasks. So what is the problem?\n\nKhusein came to the same conclusions. He returned and asked the people for forgiveness for his false notions of freedom and the mistakes he had made. Whatever the case, it is already good if even one person realizes before the end of his days that he was mistaken. That is my opinion."
che.25.a: "Akhmat is power!"

che.26.t: "Chechnya with the President"
che.26.desc: "Friends, the night was difficult, and the flights left no time to voice my position on this vile TREACHERY!\n\nWhat is happening is a STAB IN THE BACK and a real military mutiny!\n\nI have warned more than once that war is not the time to voice personal grievances or settle disputes in our rear. The rear must always remain calm and reliable. Imagine what the guys in the trenches are feeling now, with the enemy in front of them and a treacherous adventure behind their backs. This is about stability, national unity, and the safety of our citizens.\n\nWe have a Supreme Commander-in-Chief, elected by the people, who knows the entire situation down to the smallest detail better than any strategist, and certainly better than any businessman. He personally calls commanders 'on the ground' and fully controls the course of the Special Military Operation. The decisions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief are made deliberately and meticulously. Each of us sees only a part of the map, while he sees it all! And Vladimir Vladimirovich rightly noted in his address to the nation – this is a military mutiny! There is no justification for such actions!\nI fully support every word of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!\n\nFighters of the Ministry of Defense and the National Guard in the Chechen Republic have already departed for tension zones. We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood!"
che.26.a: "The mutiny must be crushed"

che.27.t: "'Akhmat' Approaches Rostov"
che.27.desc: "The 'Akhmat' special forces column has entered the Rostov region from the SMO zone to restore order. The unit is stationed in the Aksay area, 7 km from Rostov-on-Don, and is on full combat readiness. We await orders from the command, and as soon as they are given, we will begin clearing the city of the bandit groups of the traitor Prigozhin."
che.27.a: "Allahu Akbar!"
