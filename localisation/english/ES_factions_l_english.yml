 faction_manifest_ensuring_multipolarity_goal_desc: "Events unfolding in the 21st century clearly demonstrate the fragility of the unipolar system of global politics. The United States and its European satellites guarantee not peace and justice, but only the rule of might, imposing alien values on other countries, not treating them as equal partners in dialogue, violating their own commitments and destroying those who disagree with their position through bombing, often turning a blind eye to the crimes of states friendly to them. Russia, having risen from the ruins, categorically disagrees with the current reality.\n\n«When we talk about multipolarity, this does not mean that some new hegemons should emerge. No one poses the question that way—neither within the SCO nor within BRICS. All participants in international relations must have equal rights.»\n— V.V. Putin"

 faction_manifest_the_standoff_with_russia_goal_name: "Standoff with Russia"
 faction_manifest_the_standoff_with_russia_goal_desc: "Having won the Cold War, Europe breathed a sigh of relief, freed from a constant threat. But 30 years later, the shadow of war has once again fallen on the continent. Russia flagrantly violated international law by annexing Crimea and sponsoring the uprising in Donbas. The peace process has failed to reconcile the parties and satisfy Moscow's imperial ambitions. The sword of escalation is grinding out of its sheath to cut the knot of diplomacy and negotiations, spilling blood on Ukrainian soil. Europe must curb Russia's aggressive plans, for it is unknown where and when they will stop.\n\n«There can be no unilateral division of a sovereign European nation, and borders cannot be changed by force. If we legitimize and formalize the violation of borders today, we will open the door to new conflicts tomorrow,»\n— Ursula von der Leyen."
 faction_manifest_creation_of_caucasian_emirate_goal_name: "Creation of the Caucasus Emirate"
 faction_manifest_creation_of_caucasian_emirate_goal_desc: "Following Prigozhin's successful march, centralized power in Russia collapsed, particularly in the Caucasus. Radical Islamists, who had been hiding underground for years, suddenly stepped up their activities, attacking security forces and government officials, once again raising the banner of jihad in the Caucasus and publishing their manifesto:\n\n«The Caucasus is occupied by infidels and apostates and is Dar al-Harb, a war zone, and our immediate task is to turn the Caucasus into Dar es Salaam, establishing Sharia law on its soil and expelling the infidels. After expelling the infidels, we must reclaim all historical Muslim lands, and these borders lie beyond the Caucasus. I anticipate the objections of all educated and uneducated hypocrites alike, but I would like to say that, Insha'Allah, the Caucasus Emirate is a formation that is more real than all the artificial colonial zones that exist today…\n\nTo say that we want to build some kind of enclave on the territory of these several North Caucasus republics is incorrect. No, today many Muslims living in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Buryatia, as well as Russians who have converted to Islam from various regions of Russia, are taking the oath. And wherever they are—Moscow, Blagoveshchensk, Tyumen, Vladivostok—when a Muslim takes the oath, they become a fighting unit.»"
