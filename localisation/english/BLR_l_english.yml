BLR_influence_category_gui: "Belarus is located in close proximity to the heart of Russia - Moscow. It also has a border of more than 800 km. Russia is not ready to hand over such a country to NATO. But it is much more profitable for Belarus to get rid of any foreign influence. NATO is ready to sponsor the opposition until a revolution is carried out."
