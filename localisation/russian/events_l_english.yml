 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:1 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact to address the Comintern's goal of spreading Communism worldwide, through the use of subversion and violence. By signing this pact, we agree to share intelligence on the Communist threat and act in close cooperation against this menace."

 germany.5.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.6.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d:0 "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."

 germany.6.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."
 germany.11.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 germany.11.a.tt:1 "§RWhile the pact is in effect, the Closed Economy trade policy will be unavailable.§!\n"
 germany.11.b:0 "No deals with the fascists!"
 germany.12.t:0 "Moscow Signs the Pact"
 germany.12.d:1 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:1 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:1 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the [SOU.GetAdjective] sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the [SOU.GetAdjective]s occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."
 germany.14.a:0 "Yes. Treaty stipulations must be obeyed."
 germany.14.b:0 "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honors the Pact"
 germany.15.d:0 "In accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, German forces have evacuated eastern Poland and our own troops have moved in to occupy the territory."

 germany.16.d:1 "[From.GetNonIdeologyName] has refused to partition Poland with us, in a blatant violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact! This betrayal has rendered our treaty with them null and void!"
 germany.16.a:0 "We were fools to trust the fascists!"
 germany.20.t:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.20.a:0 "Give Hungary Northern Transylvania."
 germany.20.b:0 "Give Hungary all of Transylvania."
 germany.20.c:0 "Transylvania shall remain in Romania."
 germany.21.t:0 "Romania Rejects Our Verdict"
 germany.21.d:0 "Romania has refused to abide by the decision we reached in the Second Vienna Award! Their delegation has been recalled to Bucharest, and no territory has been surrendered to Hungary."
 germany.21.a:0 "The will of Germany must be obeyed!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Folds"
 germany.22.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a:0 "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t:0 "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d:0 "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a:0 "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.24.c:0 "No, our advisors will stay, just as we have promised the Chinese."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisors Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisors have been recalled."
 germany.25.a:0 "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that were reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.26.a:0 "Good man!"
 germany.27.t:0 "Fortifying the Westwall"
 germany.27.d:0 "Army pioneers have finished their survey of our existing fortifications, and identified the locations where they should be strengthened. The necessary construction orders have been placed."
 germany.27.a:0 "This will hold better than the Siegfried Line."
 germany.28.t:0 "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d:0 "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a:0 "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b:0 "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t:0 "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d:0 "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."
 germany.29.a:0 "We must prepare for a military intervention."
 germany.40.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.d_3:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between the Netherlands, Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the Dutch position be?"
 germany.40.a:0 "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b:0 "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.41.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have made it clear that they have no intention of going to war over a 'quarrel in a far-away country.' Should we follow their lead, or will we honor our obligations to Czechoslovakia by offering them support?"
 germany.41.a:0 "Leave the Czechs to their fate."
 germany.41.b:0 "The British be damned! France supports her friends!"
 germany.42.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have refused to back down, and are instead threatening the Germans with war if they violate Czechoslovakia's borders. War may be imminent."
 germany.42.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 germany.42.b:0 "France should stay out of this."
 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"
 germany.43.d:0 "The stubborn French have refused to follow our lead in the Sudeten Crisis! They stand by their support of Czechoslovakia, and since we do not they have decided to rescind our mutual alliance. Even now, France is preparing for an imminent war with Germany."
 germany.43.a:1 "Fools! [GER.GetLeader] must be appeased!"
 germany.44.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nFortunately, it looks like the Allies will stand by their earlier promises of support. They have threatened [GER.GetLeader] with war if our borders are violated in the slightest. Despite this, we must prepare for an imminent German attack."
 germany.44.a:0 "Good! Let them come!"
 germany.45.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nThe British cowards have refused to back our sovereignty, but at least the French are sticking up for us! They have abandoned their alliance with Britain and formed a new one with us, promising to support Czechoslovakia against German aggression."
 germany.45.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 germany.46.t:0 "The Munich Diktat"
 germany.46.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nBoth the British and French have rescinded their earlier promises to support us against German aggression. Their diplomats have made it clear that if we choose to resist the Germans, we do so on our own. Perhaps we have no choice but to surrender the Sudetenland..."
 germany.46.a:0 "This is a dark day for Europe."
 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British and their Allies have both rejected our rightful claims to the Sudetenland, and they have threatened us with war if we 'violate' the Czech border!\n\nA plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been drawn up, but this will likely trigger a general European war. We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.48.a:0 "This may work to our advantage."
 germany.49.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nDespite the hopelessness of their situation, the stubborn Czechs are refusing to surrender their territory! We will have to take it by force. An invasion plan has been prepared that will wipe this vile experiment of Versailles off the face of the Earth!"
 germany.49.a:0 "The Czechs must be destroyed."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognizing the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.50.a:0 "This is a historic day for Germany."
 germany.51.t:0 "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a:0 "About time!"
 germany.52.t:0 "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."
 germany.52.a:0 "Zaolzie is ours!"
 germany.53.t:0 "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.53.a:0 "Give in to the Germans."
 germany.53.b:0 "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t:0 "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a:0 "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d:0 "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2:0 "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a:0 "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b:0 "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c:0 "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.56.t:0 "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d:0 "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2:0 "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.a:0 "Of course! Greater Hungary will soon be a reality!"
 germany.56.b:0 "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t:0 "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d:0 "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."
 germany.57.a:0 "Set up Tiso's puppet government."
 germany.57.b:0 "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t:0 "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d:0 "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a:0 "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.60.a:0 "This is an act of war! Rally the British to our side!"
 germany.60.a.tt:0 "§RIf war breaks out, we will suffer a civil war due to our §YDisjointed Government:§!§!\n"
 germany.60.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic objection."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French are mobilizing their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.61.a:0 "A war is out of the question."
 germany.61.b:0 "We must stand by France!"
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.62.a:0 "We will issue an objection as well."
 germany.62.b:0 "Versailles concerns us no longer."
 germany.63.t:0 "Britain Refuses War"
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarization of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.63.a:0 "Yes! Germany must be dealt with now."
 germany.63.b:0 "No, without the British we must back down..."
 germany.64.t:0 "Britain Supports Us"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognized the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.64.a:0 "Onwards!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilize!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarization of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilizing their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarized, or our nations are at war."
 germany.65.a:0 "We cannot back down! The Reich must be defended!"
 germany.65.b:0 "We are unprepared for this confrontation. We must back down."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilizes!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarization of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilizing their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realized that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilized and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.67.a:0 "A war now would be madness."
 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."
 germany.68.a:0 "Perhaps it was inevitable."
 germany.70.t:0 "The Oster Conspiracy"
 germany.70.d:0 "Believing that Hitler has pushed Germany into a war it cannot win, a group of senior officers within the Wehrmacht have launched a coup! It appears to have been orchestrated by Colonel Hans Oster of the Abwehr, but generals Beck, von Brauchitsch, Halder and Admiral Canaris have also been confirmed as involved!\n\nHeavily-armed men lying in wait in several Berlin apartments have converged on the Reichskanzlei intent on liquidating Hitler and his closest associates. A fierce gun battle is currently raging inside the building."
 germany.70.a:0 "Protect the Führer at all costs!"
 germany.71.t:0 "The Führer is Dead"
 germany.71.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, but not before the dogs managed to kill Hitler! The Führer was found with several dozen gunshot wounds slumped over his desk - working tirelessly for the Vaterland to his last breath, no doubt!\n\nThe surviving conspirators will stand trial for their heinous crime, but for now Germany is at war and a new leader is needed. Who shall be the next Führer?"
 germany.71.a:0 "Herr Himmler will lead us into the future."
 germany.71.b:0 "Herr Göring is the logical choice."
 germany.72.t:0 "The Conspiracy Fails"
 germany.72.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, and Hitler himself led the clean-up effort with his trusty Luger. Miraculously, the Führer emerged from the fighting with only a few scratches.\n\nThe surviving conspirators will pay a steep price for their disloyalty, and Hitler is now even more committed towards prosecuting the current war towards a glorious victory!"
 germany.72.a:0 "Long live the Führer!"
 germany.73.t:0 "The Conspiracy Succeeds"
 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in the Reichskanzlei has reduced the building to a burning ruin. Despite a large number of SS soldiers rushing to Hitler's aid, army units loyal to the conspirators joined the fray and proved decisive. The Führer has been confirmed as killed, and the conspirators have successfully stormed all government buildings in Berlin.\n\nA large portion of the Wehrmacht has gone over to the other side, but many officers are still NSDAP loyalists. Who should be leading them?"
 germany.73.a:0 "Death to National Socialism!"
 germany.73.b:0 "Himmler will turn this around!"
 germany.73.c:0 "Göring is our only hope at this point!"
 germany.74.t:0 "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d:0 "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a:0 "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t:0 "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d:0 "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a:0 "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b:0 "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.76.t:0 "Soviets Accept German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armored units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.76.a:0 "This treaty will be a stepping stone to the future."
 germany.77.t:0 "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a:0 "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t:0 "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d:0 "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a:0 "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t:0 "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d:0 "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a:0 "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b:0 "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c:0 "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t:0 "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d:0 "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a:0 "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b:0 "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t:0 "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a:0 "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d:1 "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a:0 "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a:0 "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."

Incumbent Franklin Delano Roosevelt has already implemented several of the programs referred collectively to as the New Deal, intended to take the US out of the Great Depression.\n\nWhile many of the efforts have been popular, his plans to further extend the role and power of the government have been met with criticism from his opponent, Republican Alf Landon. Coming from the oil industry, Landon wants to see greater economic freedom, while Roosevelt and the Democratic Party want to expand Social Security and ensure economic stability. The election may be a close call, or a major victory for the Democrats."

 usa.7.d:0 "Since the office of President of the United States was first established, no president has ruled for three consecutive terms. However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, President Roosevelt has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. Republican Wendell Willkie, characterized as a dark horse candidate with a background as an industrialist with limited political experience, has been critical both of Roosevelt's economic interventionism and his justifications for running for a third term.\n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policies and Willkie wants to retain some form of the New Deal, many still consider this election a determining point for the future of American democracy."

 usa.7.b:0 "The Republicans. We want Willkie!"
 usa.8.t:0 "Landon vs Roosevelt"
 usa.8.d:0 "President Landon put a stop to the Democrats' continued New Deal reforms four years ago, choosing to rely on the nation's strength lying in industrial companies such as those he helped establish prior to his presidency. Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favor of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them. The question is who will lead the arsenal of democracy through these dire times."

The Republicans have been limited in their choices of candidates due to many potential nominees serving in the war, but have chosen Governor Thomas E. Dewey to represent them.\n\nRoosevelt continues to have popular support, but many suspect he may not live to see the end of his term.

Despite declining health, he has managed to retain much of the support which landed him the presidency previously, and is now campaigning for the Democrats again.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] is arguing that a change of leadership in America's sensitive situation would be irresponsible, which is somewhat ironic since the same claim was made before his previous victory over Roosevelt.

General Douglas MacArthur, normally devoted to his military duties, has taken the opportunity to campaign for the Republican nomination while our nation is at peace and won. He is now challenging Roosevelt, supporting the conservative coalition.\n\nRoosevelt continues to be popular, but MacArthur's charisma and sense of duty has made a strong impression on voters. Does the military really know best?"
 usa.11.a:0 "Roosevelt and Truman will pull through."
 usa.11.b:0 "MacArthur is a man of peace as much as war."
 usa.12.t:0 "Campaign of Douglas MacArthur"
 usa.12.d:0 "To challenge Roosevelt's record-length presidency, the Republicans have looked to respected military commanders, hoping to find a potential candidate to take America through this war. General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"
 usa.12.a:0 "MacArthur is needed more on the front lines than in the White House."
 usa.12.b:0 "We need him to challenge Roosevelt."

However, the possibility of FDR's death while still in office has remained, and today he passed away after suffering a stroke. Vice-President Harry S. Truman has now taken the oath of office, requesting the support and prayers of the people. The old cabinet remains, and Truman has vowed to continue many of the policies of his predecessor."

However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action.

One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName].

 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."

The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads.

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The communists call this class consciousness.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Some party members are arguing that re-inviting Trotsky and turning the purges on the Stalinists could minimize the damage of the civil war that will ensue.

Some of them believe that Stalin's rule has failed, others suspect they are simply waiting for the day when the NKVD will find or make an excuse to have them arrested.\n\nTogether, they have formed a faction powerful enough to challenge the current administration. Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counterrevolutionary traitors.

Rather than waiting to be imprisoned, executed and replaced, its leaders have decided to strike first and launch a coup with support from the similarly concerned military officials.\n\nHowever, despite its influential position, the NKVD has found it difficult to gain the trust of military leaders.

In an act of desperation, these generals have decided to attempt to overthrow Stalin's regime before this happens.\n\nAlthough unlikely to succeed in the attempt, some survivors of the Great Purge have managed to seize control in some areas of the Union.

 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."

Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

It took several hours until the police gained full control over the situation.\n\nAn ugly mood has settled over the capital as the barricades are cleared away and the dead are buried.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind. Recruitment stations across the country report that a growing number of people have come by to ask what exactly the consequences would be if a "friend" of theirs who had attempted to avoid the draft would turn themselves in."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this decision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

Faced with the prospect of a fight they could not win, the mutineers quickly decided to stand down. \n\nThe primary issue then became the fate of those that had refused orders. Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."

 mutiny_event.2.t:0 "An empty threat"
 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to supress them. Using skills honed on the front lines, they quickly organized a defense of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly. \n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."

Fate has decided that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war, it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."

While the causes for this unfortunate turn of events are very complex, the [Root.GetAdjective] demand that the other side pay for all damages caused, disarm completely and publicly acknowledge that they started the war may have been the final straw.\n\nOur enemies have responded in kind, calling our reasonable requests a demand for unconditional surrender. They have promised that they will prosecute this war until the bitter end. \n\nWith our enemies evidently unwilling to see reason and promising to fight on, attempts by the mutineers to force a peace settlement have collapsed."

Relying on numbers rather than skill, loyalist militias surrounded the mutineers' strongholds and demanded their surrender. Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own countrymen and surrendered peacefully. \n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent mutineers from forming new cells."

 mutiny_event.8.t:0 "Brother against Brother"
 mutiny_event.8.desc:0 "Our attempts to prevent the elections for the Worker and Soldier Councils have escalated the situation beyond even the most pessimistic estimation. Rather than surrendering, the mutineers have formed provisional Councils, elected field commanders and set up defenses in the streets. It is clear that they aim to make a fight out of this.\n\nThe rifts in the army now run through every unit and often even between members of the same family. [Root.GetNameDefCap] stands poised at the edge of a civil war."
