#This is going to give misleading and ugly tooltips. Making it nice will take effort. TODO_WTT_CD make nice or ignore and remove comment. Easiest solution is just making a custom tooltip that says "5 civilian factories will be converted to military factories" and ignore telling the player the states where it will happen.
